2794	SOMEONE closes the sedan's door.
2795	and sits back in his seat next to the sandy-haired SOMEONE.
2796	Gathering himself, he sniffs, flaring his nostrils.
2797	Then stares forward with a steely gaze.
2798	SOMEONE peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression.
2799	Now, SOMEONE stands below an overcast sky.
2800	Strands of his greasy black hair hang over his forehead.
2801	His gaze drifts to a road which cuts through a desolate field toward the flat horizon.
2802	In a farmhouse, gang members change clothes while eating.
2803	A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table.

2808	The woman stops him.
2809	They hold eye contact, and she lets go.
2810	As SOMEONE turns and walks away from the farmhouse, the woman continues to gaze after him.
2811	A little boy in overalls comes up and takes her hand.
2812	Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him.
2813	Now in the car as SOMEONE drives, SOMEONE looks back at SOMEONE.
2814	He faces forward and glances at SOMEONE.
2815	Now, a man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a SOMEONE gun.
2816	He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on.
2817	A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him toting a rifle.
2818	A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill.

2825	The shooter gazes.
2826	SOMEONE takes out a pistol.
2827	which the lawman kicks out of his hand.
2828	He aims his rifle at the wounded outlaw who lies on his back.
2829	As the other looks out the window.
2830	A large man in suspenders peers through the blinds.
2831	He turns away from the window and hurries out of the room.
2832	Outside, SOMEONE and his men step out of their car.
2833	As they approach the house.

2870	He sees an arriving police car and backs into a recess by a set of double doors.
2871	He knocks with the butt of his rifle.
2872	Inside the bank, SOMEONE waits as the president fills a sack with money from the safe.

2882	and they head back down the stairs.
2883	Another police car arrives down the block.
2884	In his car as the robbers exit with four hostages.

2931	He strides resolutely through the crowd and halts just behind her.
2932	and leans onto her chair.
2933	She looks up at him.
2934	He gives his head a stunned shake.
2935	Her bright red lips smile coyly.

2945	Her dark eyes probe his as they sway with the music.
2946	She allows a faint smile.
2947	SOMEONE summons up a breath and arches his brows.

2949	Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stride through the club's foyer.
2950	A gust of wind, SOMEONE turns her to face him.
2951	Her coat over her shoulders.
2952	And continues down the sidewalk with his jacket and arm around her.
2953	Later in an elegant restaurant, SOMEONE uneasily scans her surroundings.
2954	then looks to SOMEONE.
2955	She smiles, the glances at a female diner.
2956	The snobbish woman gives her the eye.

2999	With a coy smirk, she steps out from behind the counter and slips into her coat.
3000	Now in an apartment.
3001	a hand drops a rabbit's foot key chain by a tabletop sculpture of two racing greyhounds.
3002	SOMEONE leads SOMEONE down a hall into a luxurious living room.

3004	SOMEONE joins him, slipping off her coat.
3005	SOMEONE sets a simple cardboard box on the coffee table.

3007	Behind her, SOMEONE appears in his undershirt and leans through an open-air interior window.
3008	He gets a couple of glasses from a counter.
3009	then saunters off with two women.
3010	SOMEONE sits facing SOMEONE and lays his hand on the large box.
3011	The exotic beauty eyes it coolly.
3012	SOMEONE allows a subdued smile then shifts boyishly in his seat.

3016	She swallows, then raises her tender gaze to meet SOMEONE's.
3017	Her full lips curl into a smile.
3018	and the crime boss grins.
3019	They gaze into each other's eyes.
3020	Later on a bed, they smother each other with kisses.
3021	Her head, revealing a silvery blue slip, then leans over on top of SOMEONE.
3022	Glimpses of SOMEONE thrusting into SOMEONE from behind interspersed with their nuzzling face-to-face.
3023	A recent flashback shows them writhing ecstatically.
3024	Another flash shows SOMEONE kiss her mouth.
3025	His face withdraws down her chest.
3026	Later as they cuddle, they share a warm smile.
3027	Later still, SOMEONE strolls in her slip to a window seat.
3028	Open suitcases occupy every inch, filled to the brim with neatly packed clothes.
3029	SOMEONE caresses their contents.
3030	then rejoins SOMEONE in bed.
3031	She lays her head on his shoulder.
3032	Rolling over to face her, he strokes her cheek and neck.
3033	His thumb gently rubs her graceful jawline.
3034	His gaze pours over her face and he grins.
3035	SOMEONE gazes dreamily at him and he gives her another smile.
3036	His thumb caresses her cheek in a gently rhythm.
3037	He flashes a puckish grin.
3038	To his ear and a handheld mic at his lips.
3039	Later, the Pierce-Arrow pulls up to a curb.
3040	SOMEONE drives with SOMEONE at his side.
3041	Two other G-Men approach the luxury car.
3042	One of the street agents looks to his young partner who bows his head.
3043	SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
3044	He points, then gets out and faces the young G-Man.
3045	SOMEONE leads him across the street to a tawny white apartment building.
3046	Inside, they enter a long, dim hallway.
3047	SOMEONE leads Agent Barton to a door, then readies his hand on his gun.
3048	We watch the agents from afar as they prepare.
3049	the lengthy corridor dwarfing their trench-coated forms.
3050	SOMEONE lifts his knuckles to the door.
3051	It opens, revealing a young woman in a demure house dress.
3052	her strawberry blonde hair frames her face in a curly bob.
3053	SOMEONE steps toward the doorway.
3054	As he enters, SOMEONE lingers in the hall.
3055	At a table, a stout man eats.
3056	The baby-faced man nods.
3057	She steps away.
3058	Returning.
3059	the woman shows off her shoes.
3060	She holds out the open wallet as well.
3061	SOMEONE eyes it and gives a nod.
3062	SOMEONE leaves, shutting the door.
3063	The woman looks wearily to the stout gentleman at the dining table.
3064	Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter a stairwell.
3065	SOMEONE hurries downstairs.
3066	Rushing from the building, he runs across the street to Agent SOMEONE.
3067	In the stairwell, SOMEONE peers through a window in the door.
3068	Squinting, he steps into the hallway and lets the door swing shut behind him.
3069	From the stairwell, our gaze lingers on the door, then drifts over to a set of elevators.
3070	Opens, revealing a tall man with rugged features.
3071	He steps off and heads for the door.
3072	In the hallway.
3073	SOMEONE sees the rugged man behind him.
3074	The stranger stops.
3075	Behind SOMEONE, a stout, baby-faced man steps into the hall and shoots him.
3076	G-Man lurches and falls.
3077	In the street, SOMEONE turns.

3080	SOMEONE whips out his gun and peers at a car parked in the alley.
3081	Inside, SOMEONE enters the hallway and raises his gun.
3082	He advances cautiously.
3083	SOMEONE stops, looking down.
3084	Glancing warily ahead, he crouches.
3085	SOMEONE' mouth drops open as he stares downward.
3086	On the floor, a blood pool spreads beneath SOMEONE.
3087	As the wounded man twitches feebly.
3088	SOMEONE watches with a clenched jaw.
3089	His expression grows solemn and he glares down the hall.
3090	He rises, leaving a lifeless SOMEONE.
3091	Outside, SOMEONE sees two men hurrying down the alley steps.
3092	The baby-faced shooter raises a SOMEONE gun.
3093	pulling out.
3094	He takes cover behind a garden plant.
3095	As the two criminals get into the parked car.
3096	a panic SOMEONE leans out an open window.
3097	Outside, two agents pull their car up as their superior exits the building.
3098	SOMEONE stops, staring with his mouth agape.
3099	The agent shifts his rueful gaze.
3100	With a slow, deliberate stride, SOMEONE steps closer to his man.
3101	His frustrated gaze scans the agents, his breath puffing visibly in the night air.
3102	He steps away.
3103	Daytime, a bank's door is open and three men in long coats enter.
3104	Our gaze drifts up to find SOMEONE between SOMEONE and a heavyset thug.
3105	The two leaner men split off together.
3106	SOMEONE encounters a guard, sucker punches him, and bangs his head against the counter.
3107	Without breaking his stride, SOMEONE draws a gun in each hand.
3108	The bankers all obey.
3109	SOMEONE shifts his aim.
3110	A banker leads SOMEONE to a vault.
3111	As SOMEONE talks on the phone.
3112	SOMEONE shifts his resentful gaze and works his jaw.
3113	In Chicago, SOMEONE grimly lowers the phone and shifts his troubled gaze.
3114	Features disembarks flanked by two associates.
3115	He peers down the platform.
3116	The three newcomers make their way down the platform, suitcases in hand.
3117	Now, travelers mill about on a vast terminal's marble floors.
3118	The three arriving.
3119	pause taking in their surroundings.
3120	Now, at a shoeshine stand.

3132	SOMEONE stares off.
3133	SOMEONE frowns, shifts in his seat, and squarely faces SOMEONE.
3134	She hangs her head.
3135	SOMEONE allows a thoughtful smile.
3136	Leaning forward, she cups the back of SOMEONE's head in her hand and presses her lips to his.
3137	He pulls away.
3138	Bush grows by a burrowed cactus and a healthy saguaro.
3139	Across the street, a sign on a large brick building reads Hotel Congress.
3140	SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter the lobby.
3141	and stroll toward the front desk.

3147	Later, he opens a window and pulls the sheer curtains closed.
3148	The gang leader takes off his suit coat and handgun.
3149	then ambles to a set of closed double doors.
3150	Pushing one open, he peeks into a bathroom.
3151	SOMEONE sits nude in the tub.
3152	As he opens the door all the way.
3153	she seductively slides her hands up the porcelain, out of the water.
3154	then lifts one shapely leg and caresses the tub's rim with her foot.
3155	She runs her toes along a soap dish.
3156	As Johnny turns back to the bedroom.
3157	the door bursts open.
3158	The balding man from the front desk leads other men in and clouts SOMEONE.
3159	Handcuffs.
3160	and SOMEONE runs out wearing a towel.
3161	The door showing an isolated cell block.
3162	Inside, the officers lock SOMEONE inside a holding cell.
3163	and remove his handcuffs through the bars.
3164	Wearing cowboy hats, the officer's head out.
3165	SOMEONE massages his wrists, gazing off.
3166	He paces forward and leans tensely on a rail attaching the cell bars one to the next.
3167	Now, the balding undercover officer knocks on the cell block door.
3168	In his cell, SOMEONE flips through a magazine.
3169	He looks up.
3170	The balding officer leads SOMEONE into the cell block.
3171	Other lawmen observe from a side table.
3172	Wearing a crisp suit.
3173	SOMEONE's cell and the gang leader sets down his magazine.
3174	He stands and ambles toward the bars.

3177	The other officers and agents watch closely.
3178	SOMEONE's eyes flit up and down the stoic G-Man.
3179	SOMEONE shakes his head, his brow knit.
3180	Blinking thoughtfully, SOMEONE allows a faint smile.
3181	SOMEONE straightens to his full height.
3182	Chewing some gum, the criminal gives a cocky smile.
3183	SOMEONE pauses on his way out and faces SOMEONE.

3185	SOMEONE follows SOMEONE from inside his cell.
3186	Both men walk with their hands in their pockets.
3187	His back to SOMEONE, SOMEONE barely slows his leisurely stride.
3188	and leaves with his agents.
3189	The balding officer stays behind.
3190	SOMEONE chews his gum.
3191	Nighttime, a three-propeller plane cruises through the sky.
3192	Journalists crank movie cameras.
3193	A black-and-white view through one shows a police officer.
3194	SOMEONE's plane moves closer.
3195	Other journalists wait with flashbulb cameras.
3196	and three lawmen hold rifles.
3197	Another flare goes up.
3198	Wind whips at two trench-coated lawmen.
3199	On motorbikes accompany.
3200	Inside the prisoner's car, SOMEONE slouches, his head bobbing.
3201	Seated between two of his captors.
3202	SOMEONE keeps his pensive gaze aimed downward.
3203	along a dim street.
3204	SOMEONE's car.
3205	the criminal stares off glumly, then smiles out the window.

3213	The lawyer nonchalantly follows a second guard farther ahead.
3214	Now, a hulking black inmate strides past a row of cells.
3215	and enters a common room where SOMEONE reads a newspaper.
3216	The hulking man leans to SOMEONE's ear.
3217	SOMEONE scowls toward his cell, then heads over.
3218	The hulking inmate positions himself just outside.
3219	He waves two prisoners on.
3220	Now, SOMEONE faces the bars in the back of his cell.
3221	The lawyer, SOMEONE, sits in a corridor on the other side.
3222	sits back and heaves a misty sigh in the cold air.
3223	Now in a courtroom.
3224	SOMEONE sits at a council bench.
3225	A deputy escorts SOMEONE in shackles.
3226	The judge folds his hands thoughtfully.
3227	SOMEONE turns away with a humorless look.
3228	As the crowd rises, SOMEONE winks at SOMEONE.
3229	The lawyer steps away.
3230	As the deputy approaches, SOMEONE lowers his gaze.
3231	Later outside the jail, a cluster of National Guards stand watch by a waist-high wall of sandbags.
3232	Inside, the prisoner's mill about the common room.
3233	As a few deputies and guards work in a front office, a janitor enters.
3234	Later, he hangs up his coat.
3235	A guard unlocks a barred door, then raises his baton to a second metal door just inside.
3236	The guard looks through a peephole then unlocks the door for the janitor.
3237	Carrying a mop and bucket, he crosses a hallway and waits for another guard to open the door.
3238	another barred door.
3239	In the common room, SOMEONE tilts his head and clenches his jaw.

4273	She wriggles free, and dashes into another room, where she falls face down on a banquette.
4274	Behind her, SOMEONE raises his belt and brings it down hard on her back.
4275	He beats her again and again.
4276	Now in a cool blue reception area, SOMEONE paces in front of a sign emblazoned with a Colombia logo.

4562	As he follows the sidewalk, he roots around in the pocket of his cargo shorts and pulls out a set of keys.
4563	Stopping at the storefront's glass door, he unlocks it and heads inside.
4564	A sign on the window reads, Sid's Bail Bonds.

4587	With a grin, he steps to the side dragging his foot and tracking a long smear.
4588	In the bathroom, he drops SOMEONE's toothbrush in the toilet, then places it back in its holder.
4589	In the bedroom, he lounges on SOMEONE's bed - his muddy shoes on her duvet.
4590	He snacks on a pile of nacho cheese Doritos, spilled conveniently within reach.
4591	SOMEONE deletes saved episodes of Weeds and 30 Rock from SOMEONE's TiVo.
4592	Meanwhile, SOMEONE keys into a clean white front door.

4611	SOMEONE grabs the phone and hits redial.
4612	He hits the disconnect button.
4613	Now, in SOMEONE's pink-tiled bathroom, SOMEONE searches a vanity then picks through dirty laundry strewn around the tub.
4614	She finds a bar coaster in a pair of jeans.
4615	A note on the back reads, Audit Evidence Depository. Missing shit.

4621	Later, the baby blue ragtop crosses the bridge.
4622	Later still, it drives beneath an overpass sign reading, Welcome to Atlantic City.
4623	A billboard, featuring SOMEONE's mother, reads, Kitty Borgata.
4624	Now, we glimpse lavish buildings housing Atlantic City's hotel casinos.
4625	In a lounge, Kitty stands in the spotlight on a stage.

4761	Later, it opens revealing a disheveled SOMEONE clutching a drink.
4762	His shirt half untucked and his collar sticking up, he staggers out and drains the glass.
4763	Now he stumbles down the hall, leaning against a wall for support.
4764	The drunken man takes a rest then hobbles forward and bends over his door lock.
4765	He disappears inside.
4766	In the bedroom, SOMEONE lies asleep.
4767	Her handcuffed arm leaning vertically against the headboard.
4768	SOMEONE eyes her, swaying, then sets his gun on the nightstand.

4772	Raising her brow, she looks around thoughtfully, then sits up and peeks over at SOMEONE.
4773	Just past him, she spots his gun on the nightstand.
4774	SOMEONE lies on her back then rolls toward him.

4776	She props herself up on her hands and knees then inches closer and reaches for the gun with her free hand.
4777	Her fingers fall short.
4778	She tips off balance but catches herself before landing on top of SOMEONE.

4802	In the bathroom, SOMEONE steps out of the shower, tucking a towel around his waist.
4803	In the bedroom, SOMEONE zips up SOMEONE's satchel.
4804	She tugs at the handcuff then hunkers down and winds up swinging the bag.
4805	She flings it across the room.
4806	It misses the ottoman and lands on the floor.
4807	In the bathroom, SOMEONE looks up.
4808	As he opens the door, SOMEONE lies down and mimes a yawn.
4809	She sits up and looks around.
4810	She points at the handcuff.

4812	Massaging her wrist, SOMEONE strides to the bathroom.

4822	Later, at the elevators, she presses the call button.
4823	One opens behind her and she hurries aboard, shoes in hand.
4824	Another elevator opens and the chiseled thug strides out.
4825	He glimpses SOMEONE as her elevator closes.
4826	He quickly presses the call button.
4827	as the thug searches for her a pedicab pulls up.
4828	SOMEONE hops into the shaded seat.
4829	They ride away.
4830	SOMEONE looks in her bag.
4831	The driver checks her out.
4832	SOMEONE looks off and gives a half-wince, half-smile.
4833	Later, SOMEONE pedals the stolen pedicab by herself.
4834	The teenager chases her on foot.
4835	She rides down a ramp.
4836	Now, in the hotel suite's bathroom, SOMEONE awakens on the floor.
4837	Holding his head, he sits up.
4838	Later, an aerial view shows his baby-blue Delta driving away from the Taj Mahal.
4839	Behind the wheel, SOMEONE eyes the two-inch red mark on his neck in the rear-view mirror then touches it and winces.
4840	Now, SOMEONE struggles to pedal down a highway.
4841	Cringing, she leans wearily over the handlebars.
4842	SOMEONE spots the pedicab from a block behind and gives a vengeful smile.
4843	SOMEONE spots him and scowls.
4844	She pedals faster.
4845	He drives up and taps the back of the pedicab with his bumper.
4846	SOMEONE gapes.
4847	SOMEONE accelerates and taps her again.
4848	Several other vehicles speed past them.
4849	SOMEONE drives up close behind her then backs off.
4850	SOMEONE pedals exhaustedly then halts, slumping.
4851	SOMEONE stops inches behind her then scoots forward and bumps the pedicab again.
4852	SOMEONE sneers.
4853	A sedan passes them and she climbs off the bike.
4854	She grabs up her purse and glares at him, then stalks around to the passenger door and reaches for the handle.
4855	SOMEONE backs up.
4856	He shifts into park and raises both hands innocently.
4857	SOMEONE glances around.
4858	She treads back to the door, her eyes locked on SOMEONE's.
4859	As she reaches for the handle, the car lurches forward.
4860	SOMEONE winces, stifling tears, then stares off.
4861	SOMEONE eyes her churlishly.
4862	Her lips tighten and she shakes her head, looking skyward.
4863	She claps a hand to her mouth.
4864	SOMEONE glances away.
4865	SOMEONE brushes her hair out of her face then sobs into her hand.
4866	He shifts the car into park, gets out, and faces his ex-wife.
4867	She stays put.
4868	Her posture wounded and childlike.
4869	He knits his brow.
4870	SOMEONE tugs on the door handle, which sticks, then gives.
4871	She climbs into the seat and slams the door shut.
4872	SOMEONE looks over his shoulder and spots a billboard in a field.
4873	It reads, Cupid's Cabin and shows a picture of a bed and breakfast in a Victorian style mansion.
4874	The bounty hunter purses his lips.
4875	He shuffles back alongside the car.
4876	In the passenger seat, SOMEONE wipes her eyes then rests her forehead on the back of her hand, hiding her face.
4877	SOMEONE sheepishly opens his door and takes his seat at the wheel.
4878	He glances at SOMEONE.
4879	He backs the car away from the pedicab, steers around it, and drives off.
4880	Now, SOMEONE leads an elderly man with fuzzy hair into the grungy bathroom.
4881	SOMEONE rests his leg on the toilet.
4882	The man takes out a giant syringe.
4883	The vet jabs the needle into SOMEONE's neck.
4884	Now, in SOMEONE's car, SOMEONE rides with one wrist cuffed to the door.
4885	SOMEONE spots a luxury pick-up in her side mirror then eyes it over her shoulder.
4886	SOMEONE aims the rear-view mirror at it.
4887	The pick-up pulls up beside them.
4888	As the chiseled thug aims a gun at them from behind the wheel, SOMEONE jams her foot on the gas pedal.
4889	SOMEONE veers onto the shoulder, then into oncoming traffic on a one-way street.
4890	The thug shoots at them from the parallel two-way road.
4891	Drawing his gun, SOMEONE returns fire.
4892	SOMEONE cowers.
4893	The pick-up swerves onto the one-way street and jams itself alongside the Delta, mangling the convertible's headlight and fender.
4894	The vehicles separate.
4895	SOMEONE bashes the pick-up and takes aim.
4896	As they speed forward, shoving against each other, SOMEONE spots an SUV headed straight for the thug's vehicle.
4897	Swerving, the chiseled man bursts through construction barricades then ramps up a stack of barricades and launches into mid-air.
4898	The pick-up lands on its roof and skids across the two-lane road.
4899	Reaching a grassy field, it tumbles onto its side.
4900	SOMEONE pulls over.
4901	She wrenches her cuffed arm.
4902	He gets out and surveys the damage.
4903	As SOMEONE jogs toward the luxury pick-up, the thug wriggles out through a window on the other side.
4904	Nearing he vehicle, SOMEONE slows and aims his gun.
4905	His assailant gets to his feet, using the pick-up as cover.
4906	The bounty hunter ventures toward the vehicles tail-end and the thug edges around its front.
4907	SOMEONE arrives on the other side and finds no sign of the gunman.
4908	Turning back, he finds himself aiming at SOMEONE.
4909	She clutches her door's broken-off inner panel.
4910	On the one way street, the thug yanks a woman from her mini-van, gets in, and speeds off.
4911	SOMEONE gawks.
4912	Later, they search the pick-up together.
4913	He opens the covered bed.
4914	He finds a golf bag.
4915	She hurls the cup at him.
4916	SOMEONE climbs out.
4917	SOMEONE notices a tag.
4918	SOMEONE glares then yields a smile.
4919	Now, SOMEONE's ragtop follows a winding road toward a mansion perched atop an immaculately landscaped hill.
4920	At the mansions entrance, they surrender the car to a valet.
4921	Inside, a pristinely quaffed woman works a reception desk.
4922	Her red painted lips primly stifle an excited smile.
4923	They follow her through the lobby.
4924	The woman frowns.
4925	The woman scowls suspiciously.
4926	SOMEONE smiles tightly and SOMEONE shakes his head.
4927	The couple steps out back and wanders through a festive picnic.
4928	He walks her to the party's edge.
4929	They find some caddies.
4930	One rumples his lips then flees.
4931	He scurries down some steps.
4932	SOMEONE gives chase.
4933	The caddy leads him down a hill and across a grassy driving range.
4934	The bounty hunter frantically dodges golf balls as they whiz toward him.
4935	He leaps over one then ducks another.
4936	One ball buzzes low over his head and a fourth whips past his nose.
4937	As he leaves the range and runs onto a green, SOMEONE drives up in a golf cart.
4938	Elsewhere, the caddy peeks out from a sunken sand trap.
4939	The caddy crawls out from hiding.
4940	As he holds the flag for putting golfers, SOMEONE spies him.
4941	SOMEONE steers the cart in the caddy's direction.
4942	The young man spots them and his polite smile fades.
4943	Dropping the flag, he dashes over a hill.
4944	Cresting the rise, the cart speeds toward a pond.
4945	SOMEONE leaps out, tackles the caddy, and tumbles with him into the water.
4946	The out of control cart plunges in beside them.
4947	SOMEONE dunks him.
4948	SOMEONE dunks him again.
4949	He shows his tattooed chest.
4950	SOMEONE swaps looks with SOMEONE then releases the caddy.
4951	Now, at the tattoo parlor.
4952	she pulls her hair back.
4953	He plucks it from her neck.
4954	SOMEONE digs out his cell and holds it up.
4955	He answers it.
4956	SOMEONE frowns uneasily at SOMEONE.
4957	He ends the call.
4958	In the convertible.
4959	at a turnoff, they pass a sign reading, Cupid's Cabin.
4960	Later, they face a three-story Victorian style house with a wrap-around porch.
4961	A curly-haired woman answers the door.
4962	A chubby man arrives.
4963	SOMEONE smiles sadly at SOMEONE, who gives a nostalgic nod.
4964	SOMEONE and SOMEONE muster smiles.
4965	SOMEONE stares, her features frozen in a thoughtful gape.
4966	The older woman gawks.
4967	Nighttime.
4968	In frumpy clothes, SOMEONE and SOMEONE dine on a patio.
4969	He eyes the adjoining building.
4970	They share a warm smile.
4971	SOMEONE drops her gaze, fiddling with her silky honey-brown hair.
4972	She shrugs a hand.
4973	SOMEONE lifts his brow.
4974	Looking away, she shrugs again.
4975	SOMEONE blinks at her.
4976	SOMEONE regards him thoughtfully.
4977	He gives a boyish half-smile.
4978	She raises her champagne glass.
4979	SOMEONE follows suit.
4980	They tap glasses.
4981	SOMEONE sips his sparkling wine with a knitted brow.
4982	SOMEONE's smile fades to a tight smirk.
4983	SOMEONE gives a sad shrug.
4984	Resting her cheek against her hand, SOMEONE shakes her head and gazes skyward.
4985	SOMEONE looks away then faces him defenselessly.
4986	SOMEONE tearfully tightens her lips.
4987	Now, the two stroll down a hallway lit cheerily with glass-shaded lamps.
4988	SOMEONE pauses to eye an inscription on one of the doors.
4989	Reaching another door, they find a lavender heart-shaped sign that reads, Bliss in rosy cursive letters.
4990	SOMEONE and SOMEONE chuckle at the frilly placard then share a warm lingering gaze.
4991	SOMEONE starts to open her mouth, then shakes her head and smiles.
4992	Staring at her intently, he nods.
4993	As he unlocks the door, he steps in close and leans his face toward hers.
4994	SOMEONE opens the door, revealing a narrow four-post bed on a lavender carpet.
4995	Table lamps cast their soft glow against the rosy wall.
4996	SOMEONE gestures her inside and SOMEONE precedes him.
4997	At the Borgata lounge, Kitty takes a phone call.
4998	SOMEONE drops by.

5000	Checking SOMEONE's wallet, he finds their wedding photo.
5001	It shows SOMEONE and him beaming as bride and groom.
5002	SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, who waits in the hall.
5003	He shuts the door.

5011	SOMEONE lights candles around the room and pops a CD into a player.
5012	SOMEONE peeks out from the bathroom.
5013	His back to SOMEONE, SOMEONE hangs up.
5014	His ex-wife returns to the bathroom unnoticed.
5015	Now, she steps out wrapped tightly in a bathrobe.
5016	She avoids SOMEONE's gaze.
5017	Marching to the bed, she blows out a candle on a bedside table, turns off the CD player, and hurls some pillows to the floor.
5018	She throws down more pillows until only a few remain.
5019	She blows out another candle and climbs under the covers.
5020	Lying on her back, SOMEONE closes her eyes then sneakily peeks one open.
5021	She watches as SOMEONE blows out more candles.
5022	He snuffs the last one with his hand.
5023	He pops a candy into his mouth and climbs into bed fully clothed.
5024	He scoots up against SOMEONE and folds his arms.
5025	SOMEONE eyes him as he chews.
5026	He glances over and she looks away.
5027	He closes his eyes.
5028	She climbs out of bed and grabs a blanket then swipes the pillow out from behind SOMEONE's head.
5029	He bumps the headboard.
5030	As he winces, SOMEONE throws the pillow at his face.
5031	She settles onto a window bench.
5032	Closing his eyes, SOMEONE folds his hands behind his head.
5033	From the bench, SOMEONE turns and glares at him.
5034	Later, she wears her own clothes as she slams the suite's door.
5035	SOMEONE stirs.
5036	He finds himself cuffed to the bed.
5037	SOMEONE jingles the handcuff keys.
5038	She leaves.
5039	SOMEONE yanks on his cuff secured tightly to the headboard.
5040	As SOMEONE races out the door, SOMEONE frantically yanks on the headboard.
5041	He breaks off the top and falls back onto the bed.
5042	Now, as he rushes outside, SOMEONE pulls his car out of the drive.
5043	Still attached to the headboard, he chases after her.
5044	The convertible speeds away.
5045	He watches as it disappears around a corner.
5046	Meanwhile, at a gas station, SOMEONE opens his trunk.
5047	He plucks a bill from the garbage bag full of cash and heads toward a convenient store.
5048	SOMEONE halts, gives SOMEONE the finger, and steps into the store.
5049	SOMEONE spots SOMEONE's car as it rides by.
5050	At cupid's cabin, as SOMEONE stands on the front stoop, SOMEONE shuts the door.
5051	SOMEONE watches as a black luxury sedan pulls up to the porch steps.
5052	A young couple climbs out and he approaches the driver.
5053	As the couple heads up the front steps, SOMEONE climbs into the car and peels out.
5054	Meanwhile, SOMEONE drives SOMEONE's car.
5055	She spots a storefront with a Pink awning.
5056	Its psychedelic sign reads, Blue Ink Tattoos.
5057	Now, inside the tattoo parlor, SOMEONE strolls to the counter where a woman with a Mohawk and multiple piercings works.
5058	The woman glances at her.
5059	SOMEONE frowns.
5060	A bald tattoo artist eyes SOMEONE.
5061	She struts toward him, hand on her hip.
5062	She grabs her breasts.
5063	She frames her pelvis with her hands.
5064	She runs a hand down her thigh then pats it.
5065	The tattoo artist eyes SOMEONE.
5066	SOMEONE turns to the tatted clerk.
5067	Now, SOMEONE sits in a chair in a small room papered in tattoo designs.
5068	He draws a curtain.
5069	SOMEONE sits.
5070	SOMEONE's eyes widen.
5071	Sitting beside her, SOMEONE leans back and smiles.
5072	With a wave, SOMEONE hurries through the parlor.
5073	Brushing her hair out of her face, she peers over her shoulder then casually heads to the bathroom.
5074	She opens the door, steps inside, and waits briefly.
5075	Glancing around, she creeps out of the bathroom and makes her way up some stairs.
5076	Now, she opens a door to a wood-paneled entry way.
5077	She cautiously checks over her shoulder then tiptoes inside.
5078	Seen through another doorway, an office chair sits at a desk with a giant mural of a snarling tiger behind it.
5079	A red and black bowling shirt hangs on the back of the chair.
5080	SOMEONE scurries into the office.
5081	She sifts through a stack of paperwork then sits at the desk and rifles through files and drawers.
5082	Swiveling in the chair, she spots a framed photo of a bowling team.
5083	In it, SOMEONE and SOMEONE pose with two teammates.
5084	A caption reads, Police Bowling League.
5085	SOMEONE looks around then sets the photo back on a trophy shelf.
5086	Scanning the office, she follows the sound around a corner and finds a louvered door locked by a deadbolt.
5087	She undoes the lock, opens the door, and finds SOMEONE inside.
5088	His mouth and wrists duct taped.
5089	Downstairs, SOMEONE enters.
5090	Upstairs, SOMEONE cuts tape binding SOMEONE's wrists.
5091	SOMEONE leads SOMEONE out a side door then rushes back in.

5093	SOMEONE enters through the front door, spots the open closet, and draws his gun.

5095	They race down the street.
5096	Meanwhile, SOMEONE makes a call.
5097	they get in SOMEONE's car.
5098	SOMEONE's thugs sit in back.
5099	They brandish their guns.
5100	SOMEONE shrugs at SOMEONE.
5101	As SOMEONE scrambles out, SOMEONE gawks.
5102	With a parting glance, SOMEONE sprints away.
5103	SOMEONE frowns at SOMEONE.
5104	SOMEONE lets his head lull back.
5105	Now, SOMEONE spies his car in a nearby parking lot.
5106	He pulls in.
5107	A mural of two widespread female legs flanks the hot-pink back door of a strip club named, Double D's.
5108	SOMEONE climbs out of the borrowed car, satchel in hand.
5109	He checks his phone and flips it open.
5110	SOMEONE approaches a purple and white muscle car.
5111	Inside the strip club, SOMEONE eyes his phone.
5112	Outside, SOMEONE shoots the lock of SOMEONE's trunk and opens it.
5113	He finds the garbage bag of cash inside.
5114	He answers his phone and casually leans on the open trunk lid.

5116	SOMEONE enters the club.
5117	SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the cell.
5118	SOMEONE watches SOMEONE with her captors and hangs up.
5119	SOMEONE watches as the two thugs escort his ex-wife through the strip club.
5120	They stop at a neon restroom sign and she heads inside.
5121	In the bathroom, SOMEONE's shoulders sag.
5122	Across the club, SOMEONE watches the thugs unnoticed.
5123	He answers his phone.
5124	Outside the restroom, SOMEONE tosses cash at some patrons.
5125	SOMEONE hurls cash at the dancers onstage.

5132	Back in the bathroom, SOMEONE stares wistfully.
5133	He leads her through the chaos.
5134	At the pool table a formidable pole dancer piggy-backs SOMEONE.
5135	As SOMEONE shoves her off, she grabs a bottle.
5136	The woman smashes it on SOMEONE's head.
5137	He falls.
5138	SOMEONE faces the dancer.
5139	She knocks him out.
5140	Now, in the police department.
5141	In the ragtop, SOMEONE ends the call and glances at SOMEONE.
5142	The convertible speeds down a street and through an intersection.
5143	Now, in the depository building, SOMEONE packs evidence baggies filled with white powder into a brown paper bag then rolls the top down.
5144	Outside, the Delta '88 sits parked across the street.
5145	A dark sedan drives around the corner of the depository and pulls into a parking spot.
5146	SOMEONE's at the wheel.
5147	SOMEONE slumps.
5148	They lock gazes then watch SOMEONE enter the depository.
5149	Inside, SOMEONE exits a freight elevator.
5150	SOMEONE shifts his confused stare.

5158	SOMEONE releases the clerk, who grabs a phone.
5159	Now, SOMEONE creeps up a stairwell, his gun drawn.
5160	SOMEONE follows.
5161	Later, they exit the stairwell.
5162	SOMEONE fearfully trots up and hides behind SOMEONE.
5163	He glares toward her feet and she mouths, Sorry.
5164	As SOMEONE surveys their surroundings, SOMEONE takes cover behind a pillar.
5165	He irritably waves her over.
5166	A view through tall shelving units crammed with evidence shows the couple prowl forward.
5167	As they sneak, SOMEONE taps SOMEONE's shoulder and he wheels around with his gun.
5168	Blood stains the freight elevator and they glimpse a fallen man's feet.
5169	As SOMEONE skulks off, SOMEONE and SOMEONE slink toward the elevator and find SOMEONE bleeding inside.
5170	They hurry over.
5171	SOMEONE swaps looks with SOMEONE.
5172	SOMEONE stalks off, gun raised.
5173	Back in the elevator, SOMEONE looks to SOMEONE.
5174	SOMEONE glares at him.
5175	Out among the industrial shelves, SOMEONE creeps past aisles.
5176	SOMEONE hides at the end of one unit and watches SOMEONE creeping by.
5177	Back in the elevator, SOMEONE points at SOMEONE insistently then creeps out.
5178	In the depository, SOMEONE prowls down an aisle.
5179	He aims his gun around a corner and scans the vacant shadows.

5181	Elsewhere, SOMEONE ducks low then skulks forward.
5182	SOMEONE sidles down an aisle, grabs SOMEONE's shoulder, and jabs his gun against the bounty hunter's neck.
5183	Hidden, SOMEONE spots them.
5184	SOMEONE drops his gun.
5185	SOMEONE mouths, Oh God and searches the shelves around her.
5186	SOMEONE spots a pair of evidence boxes.
5187	One labeled, Gotti, K and the other Gotti, V. A long flat box beneath them reads handle with care.
5188	As SOMEONE kneels, SOMEONE finds an outline of a shotgun printed on top.
5189	SOMEONE takes aim.
5190	SOMEONE grins.
5191	SOMEONE fumes.

5194	SOMEONE misses.
5195	Punched repeatedly, SOMEONE collapses.
5196	SOMEONE kicks his weapon away from him then glances at SOMEONE.
5197	Daytime, outside.

5200	As she leaves she takes a call from SOMEONE, who limps between a warehouse and an empty lot.
5201	SOMEONE drops.
5202	SOMEONE hangs up.
5203	Later, in SOMEONE's ragtop.
5204	a sly grin spreads across SOMEONE's lips.
5205	She and SOMEONE swap warm smiles.
5206	Sunlight bathes her face.
5207	SOMEONE beams.
5208	SOMEONE skids around a corner, pulls into a curbside spot, and brakes hard.
5209	She notices the police station across the street.
5210	SOMEONE gets out.
5211	In the station, SOMEONE wears handcuffs.
5212	A female officer leads SOMEONE away as she glares at SOMEONE.
5213	The bounty hunter signs a form and the cop at the desk shakes his head incredulously.
5214	Pursing his mouth regretfully, SOMEONE waves goodbye to the cop and ambles out.
5215	Now, SOMEONE strolls outside passing an officer and handcuffed teen on their way in.
5216	As the bounty hunter descends the stoop, the arresting officer from the parade swaggers up.
5217	SOMEONE eyes him with a half-smile.
5218	SOMEONE punches him.
5219	Inside, SOMEONE uses a phone.
5220	SOMEONE shoves a cuffed SOMEONE toward a holding cell.
5221	The officers place the couple in side-by-side cells.
5222	SOMEONE shrugs and faces his ex-wife through the bars.
5223	SOMEONE beams at him and shakes her head.
5224	They share a smile.
5225	They step up to the bars.
5226	SOMEONE reaches through them and wraps her arms around SOMEONE's neck.
5227	They kiss passionately.
5228	SOMEONE strokes her ex-husband's hair then cups the back of his head in both her hands.
5229	Separating, they gaze into each other's eyes.
5230	Grinning, SOMEONE massages his neck then wraps her arms around him once again.
5231	They embrace and share a deep kiss.
5232	Her square-jawed husband stares grimly at her over his reading glasses.
5233	Breaking off his stare, he answers his cell.
5234	Now, photos of his comatose wife fill a scrapbook.
5235	At a posh house.
5236	SOMEONE sees SOMEONE hurl lawn chairs into a pool.
5237	SOMEONE briefly lowers the phone and glowers at it.
5238	Now, in windy, overcast weather, a silver sedan drives through a middle class neighborhood.
5239	As it passes, we glimpse SOMEONE riding shotgun.
5240	The car arrives at a house.
5241	Now a round-faced woman with long, black hair opens its door.
5242	SOMEONE follows SOMEONE in.
5243	The mother leads them into a sprawling cluttered living room where a chubby pre-teen girl watches TV.
5244	Sharing her mother's round face and sullen pout, she faces her visitors.
5245	Her mother looks to them indignantly, hands on her hips.
5246	SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE's angry mother.
5247	His daughter nods.
5248	She nods emphatically.
5249	SOMEONE gives a shrug of the hand.
5250	The mother faces her daughter inquiringly.
5251	SOMEONE nods.
5252	Now the woman follows the visitors out to her porch.
5253	She nods plainly.
5254	SOMEONE wears a nonplussed smile, then walks his daughter to their car.
5255	In a home office.
5256	Later, he searches stacks of documents.
5257	SOMEONE views two portraits on a wall.
5258	One shows a Polynesian woman, the other a bearded Caucasian man.
5259	SOMEONE rubs his eyes.
5260	Now, he works in a metropolitan office.
5261	A secretary looks in.
5262	SOMEONE covers a half-eaten salad.
5263	In a meeting room, he greets seven people in Hawaiian shirts.
5264	As his cousins debate, SOMEONE sits at the head of the conference table, his chin perched thoughtfully on his hand.
5265	His gaze grows distant and his hand droops.
5266	Later, he enters the hospital through sliding glass doors.
5267	We peer down a square spiral stairwell.
5268	SOMEONE climbs flight after flight.
5269	A balding doctor faces SOMEONE.
5270	Hunched forward, SOMEONE drops his hollow gaze.
5271	His eyes glisten and he hangs his head.
5272	SOMEONE nods faintly, then screws his jaw to one side.
5273	SOMEONE leans back in his seat.
5274	The doctor unhappily faces him.
5275	At the end of a hallway, a door's window frames a view of SOMEONE shambling closer, his arms hanging at his sides.
5276	He pulls the door open and passes through with a thunderstruck expression on his face.
5277	His gait is listless and steady as he makes his way past a few recovery rooms.
5278	He passes behind a staffer on the phone at a nurse's station.
5279	A distant doorway shows a nurse making a bed.
5280	SOMEONE's expression grows woeful as he nears the far end of the ward.
5281	He halts at a door to a private room and takes it in.
5282	Entering, SOMEONE finds an attractive dark-haired woman putting makeup on his gaunt wife.
5283	A fit, pleasant-faced man sits nearby.
5284	SOMEONE mocks an optimistic smile, then looks pointedly in SOMEONE's direction.
5285	Later, his car travels past a park.
5286	SOMEONE rides shotgun as he makes a right turn into a parking lot.
5287	Now in a baggy T-shirt and shorts, SOMEONE sits on the sunny beach, gazing at the surf.
5288	SOMEONE plays in shallow water near the shore.
5289	Wearing a yellow swim mask, she undulates face down in the water.
5290	Her long, brown hair clings like seaweed at her shoulders as she pops up for air.
5291	SOMEONE squints in the sunlight as he watches.
5292	He looks away briefly.
5293	As SOMEONE does a handstand, her legs wobble at unsteady angles.
5294	Now in a club restaurant, SOMEONE watches her fondly.
5295	As she eats an ice cream sundae, SOMEONE wipes ice cream from her mouth with a napkin.
5296	SOMEONE looks down and gives a noncommittal shrug.
5297	Lifting his gaze, he notices someone in the distance.
5298	His expression darkens.
5299	Behind his daughter, a muscular, blond man arrives at the bar with some friends.
5300	He notices SOMEONE.
5301	He approaches the table.
5302	SOMEONE shifts his wounded gaze.
5303	Eating her sundae, SOMEONE squints up at SOMEONE.
5304	He glances at her, starts to go, but hesitates.
5305	SOMEONE runs out.
5306	SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE.
5307	He hurries after his daughter.
5308	SOMEONE leads his daughter back.
5309	They pass the bar where SOMEONE drinks beer with his friends.
5310	The child flips him the bird.
5311	Troy responds with a resigned nod.
5312	Now a plane soars into the sky.
5313	On a map, a dotted line traces a path from Oahu to the island of Hawaii.
5314	On the plane, SOMEONE and SOMEONE peer through a window at a verdant coastline.
5315	At dusk, a red car passes terrain decorated with names spelled out in white stones.
5316	At the wheel, SOMEONE glances over at SOMEONE, who sleeps with her head leaned against the window.
5317	Later in the night, the car's headlights cut through the darkness.
5318	It turns up a driveway.
5319	Indoors, three figures step into view in a long corridor.
5320	Overhead fluorescents flicker on.
5321	A woman leads SOMEONE and SOMEONE forward.
5322	SOMEONE hurries ahead and knocks eagerly on a door.
5323	It opens, revealing a sleepy, disheveled teen.
5324	The supervisor wearily leads the visitors down the hall to another door.
5325	A partition slides down, revealing a groggy teen girl putting on glasses.
5326	Now, in the darkness, the dorm supervisor uses a flashlight to lead.
5327	SOMEONE and SOMEONE down a long stairway.
5328	They pass through a chain link gate to a driving range.
5329	Two teens flee, one falls.
5330	The girls stagger gripping golf clubs.
5331	SOMEONE grins drunkenly.
5332	Grinning, SOMEONE points at her father with her golf club.
5333	She turns away and flings it.
5334	Now, SOMEONE and his daughters arrive at home.
5335	SOMEONE obeys.
5336	SOMEONE carries a passed out SOMEONE down a hallway upstairs.
5337	Her arms hug him around the neck and her head rests against his shoulder.
5338	SOMEONE brings her into a bedroom and lays her down.
5339	The teen stirs sleepily.
5340	SOMEONE guides her raised knees down and covers her with a quilt.
5341	Heading out, he pauses at the door and glances solemnly back at her.
5342	His expression growing resigned, he leaves and shuts the door.
5343	In the morning, SOMEONE transfers scrambled eggs from a pan onto a plate with toast.
5344	He sets the meal on a table for SOMEONE.
5345	She balks.
5346	She pushes the plate away.
5347	As SOMEONE takes the plate from the table, SOMEONE shuffles in.
5348	Without meeting his gaze, the teen takes a cola from the refrigerator, sits at the table, and slurps sullenly.
5349	SOMEONE regards her with a disapproving smirk.
5350	SOMEONE tilts his head sheepishly.
5351	SOMEONE brings her the untouched breakfast.
5352	SOMEONE glares at him, glances at the plate, and leaves with an indignant sneer.
5353	SOMEONE follows her outside and finds her on her cellphone.
5354	seated at the edge of an in-ground pool littered with leaves.
5355	SOMEONE steps away, picks up a skimmer, and scoops some of the leaves out.
5356	Clad in a bikini, the teen ends her call.
5357	SOMEONE wags her bottom.
5358	Pouting, SOMEONE flips her father the bird and goes inside.
5359	SOMEONE gets in the pool.
5360	Treading water, SOMEONE stares at her father.
5361	She looks away, stricken.
5362	Blinking back tears, SOMEONE meets his imploring gaze.
5363	Surrounding by dead floating leaves, the teen looks away.
5364	She sinks down beneath the water and holds her head in her hands.
5365	Large air bubbles escape her gaping mouth as her body shakes with sobs.
5366	Her features contort fiercely and she swims through the water.
5367	SOMEONE walks alongside her as her head emerges.
5368	She climbs out and buries her face in a colorful towel.
5369	Her father approaches with a compassionate frown.
5370	Wheeling around, SOMEONE finds him with his arms spread open to her.
5371	She leaves him.
5372	Her father watches her go with a heavy gaze.
5373	fully dressed and curled up on a sofa, SOMEONE faces its back and rests her chin on her folded arms.
5374	SOMEONE walks in.
5375	The girl blinks thoughtfully.
5376	as her father takes a seat opposite her.
5377	SOMEONE sits up, then scoots around to face him fully.
5378	He cocks his head.
5379	SOMEONE blinks quizzically.
5380	SOMEONE wears a confounded gaze.
5381	He shifts in his chair.
5382	Looking away, SOMEONE shakes his head.
5383	He springs to his feet and paces.
5384	The betrayed husband halts.
5385	His back to SOMEONE, then turns.
5386	SOMEONE's chest rises and.
5387	He registers a hint of a nod.
5388	He has helpless shrug.
5389	He has hands on his hips.
5390	SOMEONE turns away and paces restlessly.
5391	His hands curl into fists then release.
5392	Facing SOMEONE, he rubs his chin and nose.
5393	He goes out onto the porch and steps into a pair of soft-soled shoes.
5394	He hops and hobbles as he pulls them over his heels one at a time.
5395	Clambering down to his driveway.
5396	SOMEONE breaks into a run.
5397	The family man races out of a cul-de-sac and reaches a narrow, rain-soaked road.
5398	He follows it at a sprint, his brow furrowed and his arms pumping furiously.
5399	Running at a stilted, awkward gait.
5400	he reaches a hairpin curve and follows it onto a street canopied with lush trees.
5401	It leads him to a neighborhood nestled by verdant foothills.
5402	Arriving at a two-story house, he passes a little brown goat on his way up the driveway.
5403	Through a window in a cluttered kitchen, we watch him arrive at a door where he lets himself in.
5404	He ventures further into his friend's house.
5405	SOMEONE emerges on an upstairs landing.
5406	They join SOMEONE.
5407	SOMEONE stares wide-eyed at SOMEONE.
5408	SOMEONE looks away regretfully.
5409	SOMEONE heaves a breath.
5410	SOMEONE fidgets with his wedding ring.
5411	SOMEONE takes a seat and nods.
5412	SOMEONE screws his jaw to one side and faces SOMEONE.
5413	As SOMEONE sinks down in a chair, SOMEONE's gaze softened.
5414	He shrugs a hand helplessly.
5415	SOMEONE doubles over, burying her face in her hands as her husband looks on sympathetically.
5416	SOMEONE pulls a chair out from a nearby table and sits facing his friends.
5417	He leans forward, his elbows on his knees.
5418	His gaze fixes on SOMEONE, then drops morosely.
5419	SOMEONE's eyes glisten and he gives a shaky nod.
5420	He swallows hard and blinks back tears.
5421	With a resigned smirk, his gaze toggles between SOMEONE and SOMEONE.
5422	SOMEONE leaves.
5423	As SOMEONE rocks herself, her arms folded, SOMEONE gazes remorsefully after his friend.
5424	SOMEONE heads down the sun-dappled driveway past the goat.
5425	SOMEONE catches up to him.
5426	SOMEONE gives a small nod and goes.
5427	SOMEONE heads back toward his house.
5428	Now, on a bridge stretching over a sparkling stream, SOMEONE weeps into his hand.
5429	He wipes his face.
5430	Keeping his head down, he wipes his eyes and continues across the bridge.
5431	Now he hikes wearily across a healthy lawn bordered by a stone wall.
5432	The stone one meets a second wall of painted cinder block, that's stained along the top with mold.
5433	SOMEONE arrives at the cul-de-sac leading to his driveway.
5434	He heads toward his home, passing lush flowering shrubs.
5435	SOMEONE turns.
5436	He approaches the pool area where his daughters share a lounge chair.
5437	A teen boy reclines in a chair beside them.
5438	SOMEONE extends a hand.
5439	SOMEONE bounds up and clasps it.
5440	He throws an arm around SOMEONE in a brotherly hug.
5441	SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
5442	SOMEONE eyes the teen boy with a skeptical frown.
5443	SOMEONE grins and shrugs.
5444	The reader, a man with a grey buzz cut, scowls.
5445	SOMEONE tosses it down bitterly.
5446	SOMEONE subdues a glare.
5447	SOMEONE's chin quivers.
5448	Getting to his feet, the older man steps away from the table in his beige knee socks and sandals.
5449	Wearing a white tee tucked into his khaki shorts, he keeps his back to SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE, who watch him halt on the grass.
5450	SOMEONE's mouth twists in a repressed sob and he rubs his lips back into a stoic line.
5451	His chest rises and falls and he bows his head.
5452	Later, inside, SOMEONE gently leads a silver-haired woman by the hand.
5453	Creasing his lips, he lifts his mournful gaze.
5454	She wears a vacant, confused expression as he takes her down a hallway.
5455	to a living room where the three visitors wait.
5456	SOMEONE and SOMEONE respectfully get to their feet.
5457	SOMEONE remains seated at the far end of the room.
5458	He kisses her cheek.
5459	Now standing, SOMEONE smiles and waves.
5460	SOMEONE eyes him, then faces his wife.
5461	SOMEONE storms over to SOMEONE, who takes a step back.
5462	SOMEONE punches him.
5463	Now, in SOMEONE's car, SOMEONE holds frozen peas over his eye.
5464	SOMEONE shows his black eye.
5465	SOMEONE touches him gently.
5466	SOMEONE pulls over.
5467	He wheels around, pointing a finger harshly at SOMEONE.
5468	Glaring, SOMEONE withdraws his hand and faces SOMEONE.
5469	SOMEONE contritely lowers his gaze.
5470	SOMEONE turns away from the teen and slumps forward morosely.
5471	SOMEONE observes her father with a concerned gaze.
5472	Unfastening her seat belt, she leans forward and hugs his seat.
5473	SOMEONE raises an eyebrow and blinks at his daughter.
5474	She climbs up.
5475	Now, the car travels along a road overlooking the ocean.
5476	SOMEONE stops the car across from a pleasant mid-century home with a copper turtle on the gate post.
5477	SOMEONE and SOMEONE duck down in their seats and discreetly cover their faces.
5478	A pickup truck passes by.
5479	SOMEONE hunches down as well.
5480	All three straighten.
5481	Working his jaw, SOMEONE briefly returns his vulnerable gaze to the stranger's house, then droops his head forward.
5482	his car's break lights blink on and he pulls away.
5483	The sedan follows the winding residential road downhill.
5484	traveling through another neighborhood, the car passes a large, beautifully landscaped house on a corner.
5485	The car backs up.
5486	A real estate sign stands posted outside the home's fence of rainbow-shaped rails.
5487	The real estate sign lists the name SOMEONE Speer and shows a happy photo of a beady-eyed man with a toothy grin.
5488	At home, trophies, medals, and beaded lace fill a set of shelves.
5489	A central photo shows a smiling SOMEONE wearing a race number on her shirt.
5490	SOMEONE uses the phone.
5491	Sitting in a day bed with a bottle of Jameson Irish Whisky at his side, SOMEONE takes a steadying breath and ends the call.
5492	As he turns off a lamp on a stand, the scene cuts to black.
5493	Now, clouds drift fast across the sky as dawn breaks at a sped up pace.
5494	Two mountains frame a distant view of fast motion traffic on a highway.
5495	Just off a coast dotted with high-rises.
5496	teams of rowers paddle canoes along the rippling turquoise water.
5497	Under a now bright sky, light traffic dots a multi-lane road.
5498	In the city, an American flag and a Hawaiian state flag hang posted on either side of a building's entrance.
5499	In the hospital, a pair of windowed doors show SOMEONE arriving with his daughters in tow.
5500	He opens one door for them.
5501	They lead the way into the ward.
5502	His daughters gaze after him as he enters SOMEONE's room alone.
5503	SOMEONE shuts the door behind him, then draws a curtain covering the windows to the ward floor.
5504	He faces his wife.
5505	He glares down at his comatose wife and circles the bed.
5506	His wife lies slack-jawed and motionless.
5507	Leaning close, SOMEONE holds an anguished stare.
5508	He straightens, picking up a teddy bear from the bed.
5509	SOMEONE starts to gesture with it, then hurls it across the room.
5510	Catching his breath, he smooths his graying hair and steps away.
5511	SOMEONE draws himself up and leaves the room.
5512	A regal chipped frame displays a photo of a little girl with golden hair.
5513	On a windowsill, a varsity letter P stands propped against a diploma.
5514	Another photo shows a radiantly smiling SOMEONE.
5515	SOMEONE ambles into the hospital room, her eyes fixed on her mother.
5516	Reaching the foot of the bed, she glances at SOMEONE, then takes another step closer.
5517	Her comatose mother's chest rises and falls under her tracheostomy tube.
5518	He spanks her.
5519	He hustles SOMEONE out of the room.
5520	SOMEONE's glistening eyes glance between her father and mother.
5521	She turns to face to bed.
5522	Later, SOMEONE sits next to SOMEONE, while SOMEONE reads in a chair facing the foot of the bed.
5523	SOMEONE leads a taller girl into the room.
5524	SOMEONE gives a halfhearted wave.
5525	SOMEONE glances around, then joins her friend at SOMEONE's bedside.
5526	SOMEONE nods.
5527	SOMEONE exits.
5528	SOMEONE eyes her sister.
5529	SOMEONE points to SOMEONE, who guiltily averts her gaze.
5530	SOMEONE grabs his cellphone from a counter.
5531	then leans forward heavily.
5532	The display indicates an incoming call from Gold Coast Real Estate.
5533	SOMEONE shows the cellphone to SOMEONE and her eyes widen.
5534	She grabs it from him and crosses the room.
5535	She hangs up.
5536	Nodding softly, SOMEONE shifts his thoughtful gaze.
5537	Now, over a dozen cars fill the King's driveway.
5538	Inside, using chopsticks, people fill their plates with crabs and sushi.
5539	SOMEONE and SOMEONE peruse the buffet table while other guests convene in the next room.
5540	A woman with short, grey hair chats with some friends.
5541	In the kitchen, SOMEONE gazes off sullenly.
5542	He takes a sip of scotch.
5543	A teenage boy enters the room and approaches him from behind.
5544	He takes another sip of his drink.
5545	SOMEONE shakes his head, struggling to retain his composure.
5546	He chuckles to himself but quickly succumbs to sobs.
5547	The others look on mournfully.
5548	He wipes his nose.
5549	That evening, he crosses the driveway.
5550	He waves to the last departing car as he watches it drive off.
5551	A breeze blows through the bushes flanking the end of the driveway.
5552	Heading back for the house, SOMEONE shuffles across the lawn.
5553	He drops to his hands and knees, hanging his head low to the ground.
5554	Sitting back on his ankles, the weary husband rests his hands on his thighs and gazes off pensively.
5555	Now, he sits in his office over a load of paperwork.
5556	They notice the recorder in his hand.
5557	SOMEONE lowers her gaze and bites her bottom lip.
5558	Now, as a Hawaiian Airlines jet takes off.
5559	the image dissolves to the map of Hawaii with a dashed line leading from Oahu to Kauai.
5560	On the flight, SOMEONE chats with SOMEONE.
5561	SOMEONE listens to music.
5562	Across the aisle, SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE's black eye.
5563	He turns his wry gaze away and awkwardly finds himself face to face with the large goateed passenger to his left.
5564	SOMEONE abruptly faces forward.
5565	Later, outside an airport.
5566	a friendly-faced guy comes hurrying over.
5567	Now, a hula girl doll bobbles on the dashboard of a moving vehicle.
5568	The white open-top jeep cruises down a beachside road.
5569	The kids ride in back with the wind in their hair.
5570	SOMEONE and his cousin sit up front.
5571	The white jeep makes a left turn off the coastal highway onto a side street.
5572	then heads down a dirt road bordered by a wooden fence.
5573	A distant mountain range spans the horizon.
5574	Later, SOMEONE chains a metal gate to a wooden post and returns to the jeep, beyond which a herd of cows grazes in a field.
5575	A few cows stand in their way.
5576	Later, the jeep travels a winding dirt path wide enough for only one vehicle.
5577	Our view pulls back to encompass the landscape, which includes lush trees and rolling hills.
5578	Heading uphill, the jeep jostles its passengers.
5579	It reaches the summit of the tree-lined road and rolls to a stop.
5580	SOMEONE steps out.
5581	The others climb out as well.
5582	SOMEONE shuts his passenger door.
5583	As the group continues up the dirt road, our view turns to follow them.
5584	SOMEONE runs out on a grassy ridge past the corner of an old stone foundation.
5585	They all stop on the scenic overlook.
5586	Below lies a majestic cove of wild undeveloped land.
5587	The tide rolls in gently on the distant beach.
5588	SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE with a faint smile, then sighs.
5589	Hovering over the group, our view turns away from the grassy ridge, for a final glimpse of the vast cove and its pristine surroundings.
5590	Now, we pull back from a faux Italian statue of Neptune towering over the center of a fountain, with scalloped ridges evocative of an oyster shell.
5591	The jeep drives by, following a bend in the road.
5592	We drive past a sign for Sandpiper Village, another for Paniolo, then a golf course abutting a housing community.
5593	Riding in the passenger seat, SOMEONE holds his forehead as he absently gazes out his window.
5594	The jeep arrives at a hotel, driving past a fountain near the entrance.
5595	Later, at the front desk, SOMEONE folds up his wallet.
5596	A clerk looks up the name on his computer.
5597	Now, at the beach, he ambles over to a blanket where SOMEONE suns her back and SOMEONE lies with her head on SOMEONE's shoulder.
5598	Her bikini top filled with lumps of sand.
5599	SOMEONE wanders over to the water to shake out the sand.
5600	SOMEONE reaches behind her back and fastens her own top as her father takes a seat.
5601	Later, strolling the beach, SOMEONE shows SOMEONE a photo of SOMEONE Speer from a real estate ad.
5602	SOMEONE and SOMEONE trail behind SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they make their way down the wet sand.
5603	We draw back to take in a wide stretch of the shoreline and the misty mountain peaks beyond.
5604	A wide, low-limbed tree shades our view.
5605	The sun sets behind the watery horizon as the foursome continues along the shore toward a distant resort.
5606	the low waves lapping gently at their ankles.
5607	Now, an adults only menu pops up on a TV screen.
5608	SOMEONE mans the remote control as her family finishes dinner in their hotel suite.
5609	SOMEONE snatches the remote.
5610	Flailing her arms, SOMEONE prances out of the room.
5611	The frustrated father glances aside, then meets SOMEONE's steady gaze.
5612	SOMEONE steps out from a bathroom and shuts off the light.
5613	He plops down on his unmade bed and sits alone in the dark.
5614	Now, SOMEONE opens a door and steps into the suite's dark living room.
5615	Shuffling through the shadows, he pauses by a sofa and juts his head forward.
5616	Lying under a blanket on a fold out bed, SOMEONE rolls his head to look up at SOMEONE.
5617	SOMEONE stares at him, then shifts his frustrated gaze and nods.
5618	He switches on a lamp near SOMEONE's pillow.
5619	The teen shuts his eyes, frowning against the light.
5620	SOMEONE shakes his head.
5621	He shuffles around the fold out bed, shrugs, and takes a seat.
5622	SOMEONE nods thoughtfully.
5623	SOMEONE lifts his chin.
5624	SOMEONE settles into his pillows.
5625	SOMEONE gives a thoughtful nod and regards the teen.
5626	SOMEONE offers a kind smile.
5627	SOMEONE glances down ponderously, nods again, and trains a warm gaze on the boy.
5628	SOMEONE takes a deep breath.
5629	SOMEONE hunkers down and pulls his blanket up to his chin.
5630	The lamp blinks off and the scene cuts to black.
5631	Now, on a misty morning, the waves crawl up on the sandy beach beneath an overcast sky.
5632	In a faded black t-shirt, SOMEONE jogs along the shoreline.
5633	He moves with a rhythmic, purposeful gait, glancing occasionally over the slate-hued water.
5634	Some distance ahead, another jogger approaches.
5635	SOMEONE notices dismissively.
5636	As the lanky figure draws near, we recognize SOMEONE's face.
5637	The real estate agent gives a sportsmanlike wave as he passes.
5638	SOMEONE returns the gesture, then halts and stares back at him.
5639	His brow knits and he takes off after SOMEONE.
5640	He quickens his pace, struggling to catch up to his wife's lover.
5641	But SOMEONE's long-legged stride keeps him several yards ahead.
5642	SOMEONE works his way up to a sprint, staring at SOMEONE through wild eyes.
5643	The real estate agent turns and trots up the beach toward a row of hedges.
5644	SOMEONE pauses, watching him run toward a gate-like gap in the greenery.
5645	As SOMEONE passes out of sight, the wronged husband dashes toward the hedge line.
5646	Glancing over his shoulder, he slows, then quickens his pace to a reckless scramble.
5647	He arrives at the hedge and ducks behind it near the gap.
5648	Seen from inside, the gap shows SOMEONE darting across to take cover behind the opposite hedge.
5649	He peeks up over the top and finds SOMEONE climbing steps.
5650	to a one-story home with a broad roof, a full-length porch, and a sprawling lawn.
5651	SOMEONE stares, only the top half of his face visible.
5652	as SOMEONE kicks off his running shoes and goes inside.
5653	Staying put, SOMEONE narrows his eyes.
5654	SOMEONE comes back out, guzzling water from a bottle.
5655	He descends halfway down the porch steps, then leans back against a supporting pillar.
5656	A pretty woman with strawberry blond hair comes out, trailed by two boys.
5657	They bring plates and cups to a table on the lawn.
5658	SOMEONE's arched eyebrows knit and his eyes narrow.
5659	He slowly sinks out of view.
5660	Now, sitting on a blanket on the beach, SOMEONE leans back on his hands.
5661	Beside him, SOMEONE lies down and chats with a reclining SOMEONE.
5662	Several yards ahead, SOMEONE's form bobs in and out of view as she plays in the ocean.
5663	As SOMEONE watches her, he shoots frequent glances over his shoulder toward SOMEONE's rental.
5664	Behind him, the strawberry blond emerges with her young boys.
5665	SOMEONE notices, as the boys race to the water.
5666	The woman slows to a walk.
5667	Wearing a sun hat and a long-sleeved shirt of sky blue.
5668	she drops a large, fashionable tote in the sand, walks to the water's edge, and cups her hands around her mouth.
5669	The boys splash each other rambunctiously.
5670	SOMEONE leans toward SOMEONE.
5671	SOMEONE rolls over and sits up.
5672	She glances toward SOMEONE, then gazes after her father curiously.
5673	SOMEONE meanders down to the water's edge and stops a few feet from the woman.
5674	In her sweater and black bikini bottoms, she watches her boys at play.
5675	The woman grins good-naturedly.
5676	SOMEONE bites back a comment and faces the water.
5677	The woman offers a sincere concerned frown.
5678	SOMEONE musters a smile.
5679	The mother faces the water.
5680	Watching her, SOMEONE adopts a breezy demeanor.
5681	SOMEONE twitches himself out of a statue-like hold.
5682	SOMEONE marches from the water.
5683	As SOMEONE joins SOMEONE, Mrs. SOMEONE's smile fades and she watches him with a furrowed brow.
5684	Now, shafts of sunlight beam through gaps in the clouds, lighting up patches of the ocean.
5685	In a forest, a rusted metal bridge spans a green brook.
5686	Raindrops plop into the placid water, dotting it with tiny percolations.
5687	Now, SOMEONE, his daughters, and SOMEONE walk toward an inviting ragtag bungalow with a porch and white-fenced yard.
5688	SOMEONE leads the way up to the porch, then through the doorway.
5689	The family pauses near the threshold, taking in the thriving casual hot spot.
5690	On a small stage, three male singers perform on stools as they strum a guitar, a ukulele, and a bass.
5691	Scanning the restaurant, SOMEONE spots a man with grey, shoulder-length hair at the bar.
5692	SOMEONE sidles down the narrow gap between the bar and a wall, then rounds a corner to the other side and joins SOMEONE.
5693	SOMEONE stares confusedly.
5694	SOMEONE lowers his thunderstruck gaze, then faces the stage.
5695	SOMEONE adopts a nonchalant air.
5696	SOMEONE's easygoing smile fades.
5697	SOMEONE regards his cousin with a flinty stare.
5698	Looking away, he puts on a smile.
5699	With a worried frown, SOMEONE bridles, and blinks at his cousin.
5700	SOMEONE gets up.
5701	The cousins hug and SOMEONE sends SOMEONE off with an affectionate rub of the head.
5702	The shell shocked man lumbers across the dining area.
5703	Reaching his table, he collapses into a chair and leans back heavily.
5704	He stares off with glistening eyes.
5705	SOMEONE lifts his brow and blinks back his tears.
5706	Taking a breath, he shakes himself out of his thoughts.
5707	SOMEONE, who is seated between his daughters, faces us as though we're in SOMEONE's position.
5708	SOMEONE bobs to the music.
5709	SOMEONE looks at us.
5710	SOMEONE's looking at us as he replies.
5711	His gaze wilts.
5712	He glances at the band, then rubs his face.
5713	His weary profile shows against the backdrop of the lively performers.
5714	He idly surveys the bar, then peers over his shoulder.
5715	giving us a view of his distracted face head on.
5716	Now, under a dusky sky, SOMEONE, his daughters, and SOMEONE walk alongside a fence that borders a green field.
5717	Mountains loom in the distance.
5718	SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk a few paces ahead.
5719	SOMEONE bites her lip.
5720	At night, SOMEONE addresses SOMEONE.
5721	He leaves with SOMEONE.
5722	SOMEONE and SOMEONE make their way across the narrow road.
5723	Walking side by side, they advance on the large cottage occupied by the SOMEONEs.
5724	Moving around the house, they find SOMEONE coming out onto the back porch.
5725	SOMEONE's wife turns.
5726	SOMEONE comes out.
5727	SOMEONE's grin falters.
5728	SOMEONE goes inside.
5729	SOMEONE conjures his toothy grin.
5730	His smile vanishes.
5731	SOMEONE responds with a hangdog stare.
5732	Behind SOMEONE, indoors, SOMEONE gets drinks.
5733	SOMEONE returns.
5734	Holding his wife close, SOMEONE forces a carefree grin.
5735	SOMEONE smiles pleasantly.
5736	SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's side.
5737	As SOMEONE stares after them, SOMEONE steps into his line of sight with a firm glare.
5738	The real estate agent obediently opens the screen door.
5739	The two men go in.
5740	SOMEONE faces SOMEONE anxiously.
5741	SOMEONE leans on a counter.
5742	SOMEONE's lips form a tearful pout.
5743	SOMEONE looks away and licks his lips.
5744	Straightening, he faces SOMEONE.
5745	SOMEONE draws his dumbfounded mouth shut and nods.
5746	SOMEONE's gaze grows melancholy.
5747	SOMEONE looks down shamefully.
5748	SOMEONE responds with a bitter sneer and shakes his head.
5749	SOMEONE lowers his remorseful gaze and his lips pucker.
5750	SOMEONE bristles.
5751	His jaw tightens and he holds SOMEONE in a weary, disdainful stare.
5752	He exits the cottage.
5753	As she leans in to hug him, SOMEONE tilts his head and gives her a full kiss on the lips instead.
5754	With an intense stare, he heads off, leaving SOMEONE confused.
5755	Now, on the flight back, SOMEONE stares off pensively.
5756	Sitting behind him, SOMEONE scoots forward in her seat and claps a hand on his shoulder.
5757	SOMEONE nods faintly.
5758	Her father turns away and hangs his head.
5759	In the window seat beside her big sister, SOMEONE sleeps.
5760	with a pillow between her head and the wall.
5761	As she stirs a little, getting comfortable, the image dissolves to a corridor in the hospital.
5762	SOMEONE, his daughters, and SOMEONE trudge in from around a corner.
5763	As the girls approach SOMEONE's bed, SOMEONE wraps her arm around her sister's shoulders.
5764	They gaze at their unresponsive mother.
5765	She lies with each hand curled around a rolled up towel and her mouth hanging slack.
5766	Now, a kind-faced woman addresses SOMEONE.
5767	SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE look on from in front of SOMEONE's bed.
5768	The grief counselor's lips form a sympathetic line.
5769	SOMEONE's eyes fill with tears and she turns to her father.
5770	Seeing his woeful look, she lowers her gaze.
5771	The kind-faced counselor strokes SOMEONE's arm.
5772	Her lips trembling, the girl turns back to face her.
5773	As the counselor continues speaking, SOMEONE's face crumples in anguish.
5774	The bereaved little girl watches the woman leave with SOMEONE.
5775	then embraces her father, burying her face in his chest.
5776	He kisses the top of her head.
5777	He caresses her hair, then tilts her face up to meet his gaze.
5778	SOMEONE gently slides her hands down her sister's ponytail.
5779	Cradling SOMEONE's head.
5780	SOMEONE lifts his eyes to his older daughter.
5781	SOMEONE pushes out a breath and shifts her attention to her mother.
5782	Later, our view shifts from SOMEONE's bed.
5783	to SOMEONE doing paperwork and SOMEONE and SOMEONE reading books.
5784	From the corridor, SOMEONE peers into the room, then enters with his wife and son behind him.
5785	SOMEONE sets aside his work.
5786	He and SOMEONE hug SOMEONE and his frail mother.
5787	As SOMEONE leads her uncle and grandmother to SOMEONE's bedside, SOMEONE shifts his gaze to SOMEONE.
5788	The boy gives him a sullen look, then turns away.
5789	SOMEONE scowls at his father-in-law, then stares off bitterly.
5790	Closing his eyes, he lets his head droop.
5791	A faint smile briefly plays on SOMEONE's face as he gives the teens a surprised look.
5792	SOMEONE shrugs his lips, then joins his family at SOMEONE's bedside.
5793	SOMEONE gestures to SOMEONE and SOMEONE and they follow him into the corridor.
5794	He pulls the door closed.
5795	Opening the door a crack, SOMEONE peeks back into the room.
5796	SOMEONE and SOMEONE move in close to him and they all spy on standing at his daughter's bedside.
5797	The grief-stricken man gives a helpless shrug.
5798	then leans over SOMEONE and strokes her hair.
5799	The three outside watch sympathetically.
5800	Resting his hand on his daughter's head, SOMEONE bends down and gives her a light kiss on the cheek.
5801	He continues caressing his daughter's hair.
5802	Tightening his lips defeatedly, he withdraws his hand.
5803	He lifts his gaze from his dying daughter and glances, unfocused, toward the doorway.
5804	In the morning, sunlight peeks through a blanket of clouds.
5805	and shines down on a lush mountain ridge.
5806	At home, SOMEONE sleeps with his face resting on his cluttered desk.
5807	One of his fingers twitches and he awakes.
5808	With a frown, he sits up.
5809	Blinking groggily, he looks at his watch, then leans forward on his elbows and shifts his thoughtful eyes.
5810	He pushes his chair back from the desk and rises.
5811	He exits past the portraits of his great great grandparents.
5812	The image dissolves to a sprawling wind-blown property.
5813	SOMEONE's car glides toward a fork in a long driveway.
5814	To one side lies a large ranch style house and a tennis court.
5815	On the other, grazing ducks scatter as SOMEONE pulls over onto a well-manicured lawn and parks.
5816	Now, he enters the large house, allowing sunlight to filter through the screen door into the unlit living room.
5817	As he pushes open the curtains on the front windows.

6299	She winces disgustedly and wipes her mouth.
6300	SOMEONE faces her with a smile and she grins.
6301	Later they hike barefoot across stones in the creek.
6302	SOMEONE helps SOMEONE onto a boulder and they share a tender kiss.

6308	On the studio floor, the delivery guy brings SOMEONE a massive bouquet.
6309	SOMEONE and SOMEONE read the card.
6310	SOMEONE notices them jumping up and down as he feeds the model a spoonful of chocolate.

6312	She irritably shakes her head.
6313	 Distracted by SOMEONE, SOMEONE absentmindedly wipes the model off.
6314	Now in the SF Saloon and Grill, SOMEONE uses her cell.

6333	Later in his office, SOMEONE sees SOMEONE wave as she passes his window.
6334	He beckons her in.
6335	SOMEONE shakes her head, slack-jawed.

6353	She shifts her eyes back to the monitor and watches as SOMEONE forces a smile.
6354	Later SOMEONE strolls into a restaurant and approaches the hostess.
6355	The hostess leads him away.
6356	A disco ball hangs from the high-arched ceiling, twinkling with light.
6357	Directly below, patrons twirl on a large dance floor.
6358	SOMEONE sits in a booth, talking on the phone.
6359	SOMEONE arrives.
6360	He sits across from her with a big grin.
6361	He sips SOMEONE's drink.
6362	A waitress stops at their table.
6363	SOMEONE gazes at SOMEONE.
6364	A smile spreads across her face.
6365	SOMEONE gazes out at the dance floor, then turns to SOMEONE.
6366	He leads her to the dance floor and flings off his jacket.
6367	SOMEONE takes her hand and spins her away, then twirls underneath their joined hands, and pulls her into a tight embrace.
6368	He grins at her surprised smile.
6369	SOMEONE spins SOMEONE again.
6370	Holding both of her hands, he pushes her away, then pulls her in with her back against him.
6371	Leaning against his chest, SOMEONE slinks up and down.
6372	SOMEONE moves with her, his face buried in her hair.
6373	He twirls her away, then brings her in, wrapping one arm around her waist.
6374	With their faces a few inches apart, they spin in tight circles.
6375	SOMEONE dances backward and SOMEONE draws her back in by both hands.
6376	He dips her.
6377	She straightens with a wide grin and touches her forehead to his as they dance in a circle.
6378	He raises her arms above her head.
6379	She shimmies sexily as he runs his hands down her body.
6380	She twirls away, then moves back into his arms.
6381	SOMEONE spins her away, then pivots gracefully underneath their arms.
6382	Sending her into a twirl, he lets go of one hand and catches her by the other.
6383	She leaps back to him, wrapping her arms around his neck.
6384	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a sultry look as they embrace.
6385	Their faces draw close together.
6386	SOMEONE blinks and shrinks back slightly.
6387	SOMEONE meets her gaze for a moment, then turns away and gives a disappointed nod.
6388	As SOMEONE follows her off the dance floor, SOMEONE brushes a strand of hair away from her face.
6389	Her smile fades.
6390	Now SOMEONE's black pumps dangle from her fingers as she and SOMEONE walk to the elevators.
6391	He presses the call button.
6392	then leans against the wall with his hands in his pockets.
6393	SOMEONE shifts nervously.
6394	She hurries into the elevator.
6395	SOMEONE strolls in behind her.
6396	She gives him a sidelong glance as she slides her shoes back on.

6398	They share a look.
6399	SOMEONE shifts her eyes to the floor.
6400	SOMEONE tilts his head toward the ceiling.
6401	The elevator doors slide open and he grins awkwardly.
6402	They hug tightly.
6403	The doors start to slide shut.
6404	SOMEONE stops them.
6405	They hug again and kiss each other on the cheek.
6406	The doors start to close again and SOMEONE pushes them open.
6407	He and SOMEONE grab each other in a passionate embrace and kiss hungrily.
6408	She leans against the door frame as they heatedly make out.
6409	SOMEONE glances into the hallway.
6410	SOMEONE steps back into the elevator.
6411	He waves at her through the closing doors.
6412	As SOMEONE turns his back to the elevator, his jaw drops and his wide eyes shift disbelievingly.
6413	He heads down the hall.
6414	Now SOMEONE opens the door to her room.
6415	She sets down her belongings and sits heavily on a love seat.
6416	Her brow furrowed thoughtfully.
6417	she gazes around the room, then removes her shoes and casually tosses them aside.
6418	SOMEONE stands hastily.
6419	She smoothes out her dress, fluffs her hair, and hurries to the door.
6420	She opens it to find SOMEONE standing outside.
6421	Her face falls.
6422	He steps inside and kisses her.
6423	He sits.
6424	SOMEONE sits beside him on the love seat.
6425	She looks away.
6426	Champagne springs from the bottle in SOMEONE's hand.
6427	As SOMEONE rushes away, SOMEONE stands and removes his shirt, exposing his well-toned chest.
6428	He grins.
6429	Meanwhile, SOMEONE walks down a hallway.
6430	He stops, turns the other way, then turns back again.
6431	He rubs his nose nervously.
6432	He strides determinedly to SOMEONE's door and raises his fist.
6433	SOMEONE answers, shirtless.
6434	They shake hands.
6435	SOMEONE appears.
6436	SOMEONE watches regretfully as he shuffles away.
6437	She closes the door.
6438	As SOMEONE heads down the hall, the door reopens, and SOMEONE hurries after him.
6439	His smile fades as he meets her gaze.
6440	SOMEONE sucks in a breath and steps closer, her eyes fixed on his face.
6441	She gives him a pleading look.
6442	SOMEONE forces a casual smile.
6443	SOMEONE nods disappointedly and tilts her head.
6444	She gives a bitter smile.
6445	As it fades, she lifts her eyes to his.
6446	SOMEONE turns his back to her.
6447	SOMEONE watches sadly as he strolls down the hallway with his hands in his pockets.
6448	She takes a breath and heads back to her room.
6449	The yellow hallway lights glow harshly above SOMEONE as he hangs his head for a moment.
6450	SOMEONE enters her room.
6451	She glances around the spacious suite and finds SOMEONE sitting at the edge of the bed, wearing a clean unbuttoned dress shirt.
6452	He hands her a glass of champagne.
6453	SOMEONE chugs hers.
6454	She cringes as she finishes the entire glass.
6455	He raises his brow.
6456	SOMEONE pours herself another glass.
6457	She turns away with the bottle.
6458	She sips her champagne and leans against the back of a chair.
6459	SOMEONE shifts uncomfortably.
6460	He glances down at his exposed chest and pulls his shirt closed.
6461	SOMEONE sets her glass on the table and steps closer to him.
6462	She shakes her head.
6463	SOMEONE stares at her confusedly.
6464	SOMEONE frowns and reaches to her head.
6465	She released two hidden clips at the back of her hair.
6466	SOMEONE knits his brow as he watches.
6467	then two more on the sides.
6468	SOMEONE removes a hair extension to reveal her shorter natural length.
6469	She self-consciously brushes her bangs out of her eyes.
6470	Now at the office.
6471	SOMEONE finds SOMEONE waiting for her.
6472	Co-workers stare.
6473	SOMEONE points at each.
6474	At the CBS affiliate.
6475	SOMEONE shakes SOMEONE's hand, then pats his shoulder.
6476	A glittery shaft of sunlight on a river overtakes the image.
6477	A dozen colorful hot air balloons hover in the sky at different altitudes.
6478	An assistant feeds a cable out from a news van, as a cameraman paces toward SOMEONE, who stands by a grounded balloon.
6479	A blandly handsome man inside the basket fires up the burner, startling her.
6480	SOMEONE shakes her head.
6481	He points his finger like a gun and blows on the tip.
6482	At the station.
6483	SOMEONE glances inside his news van.
6484	SOMEONE yanks him out of the balloon.
6485	She takes SOMEONE's place in the basket.
6486	SOMEONE rises from his makeup chair.
6487	He takes the mic.
6488	She mimes jerking off.
6489	The pilot fires up the burner.
6490	The balloon rises.
6491	He climbs over the edge. He sees the cameraman far below.
6492	The control room monitor shows SOMEONE and SOMEONE in the basket.
6493	SOMEONE smacks his shoulder.
6494	They both fold their arms and pout.
6495	SOMEONE pick up a phone.
6496	In the basket, SOMEONE gazes out at the dozens of balloons hovering over a tranquil harbor.
6497	SOMEONE peeks down at the verdant ground far below.
6498	The balloon pilot produces a bottle and glasses.
6499	SOMEONE and SOMEONE sulk.
6500	SOMEONE loosens his collar.
6501	In the balloon.
6502	SOMEONE's family watches.
6503	SOMEONE beams.
6504	SOMEONE lowers her petulant gaze.
6505	SOMEONE looks away, shakes his head, and takes a few deep breaths.
6506	SOMEONE stares at him out of the corners of her narrowed eyes, then faces him.
6507	SOMEONE soberly meets her gaze.
6508	SOMEONE stares into his eyes.
6509	He looks away, shaking his head.
6510	Flinging herself at him, SOMEONE seizes his face and plants a passionate kiss on his lips.
6511	SOMEONE wraps his arms around her and they sway in their embrace.
6512	As SOMEONE leans her against the basket's edge, the pilot looks on anxiously.
6513	Keeping his lips locked on SOMEONE's, SOMEONE dismisses him with a wave.
6514	The pilot turns away and the balloon floats off.
6515	Light filters into SOMEONE's darkened bedroom through the drawn curtains, offering a shadowy view of the couple in bed.
6516	SOMEONE rolls off of her and flips on a lamp.
6517	Sitting up, SOMEONE grins.
6518	SOMEONE pounces on him and switches off the lamp.
6519	Beneath it, a low-rise bungalow perched on a gentle slope looks out over an uneven lawn under a cloudy sky.
6520	A teenage girl with short brown hair tied back in a small ponytail swigs from a little size plastic bottle as she contemplates an armchair standing on the lawn, in front of her.
6521	In flashback, the girl steps out of the knickers and walks slowly across the room towards a skinny boy sitting bare-chested in the same armchair.
6522	Wearing just a T-shirt, the girl gives a tentative smile as she straddles the boy's lap and brings her rosebud lipped mouth close to his faith.
6523	The girl stops the boy's mouth with a tender kiss.
6524	The shaggy blond dog does what he is told.
6525	The girl takes a swig of juice and wags her mouth on the sleeve of her hoodie.
6526	She picks up a pregnancy kit.
6527	She reaches for the washroom key.
6528	He hands her the key.
6529	In the washroom, she unzips her jeans and sitting down on the lavatory seat, she opens the pregnancy detection kit and brings out a narrow paddle shaped stick and puts it into position.
6530	She pulls the stick out and gives it a cursory look.
6531	Then, hurries back through to the store towards the counter.
6532	She slaps a pack of sweets onto the counter and gazes at the test.
6533	She shakes it.
6534	She rolls her eyes at the counter clerk and leaves the store, stick in one hand.
6535	Her expression is suddenly forlorn.
6536	SOMEONE slings the rope candy onto the branch of a tree and makes a noose.
6537	She bites in to the liquorish rope and wanders off home.
6538	Bedrooms, the light switch doubles as a doll's penis.
6539	Naked dolls are clustered on the mantelpiece.
6540	There's a photo of SOMEONE playing his guitar.
6541	SOMEONE dials a number on her hamburger-shaped phone.
6542	A girl lying on her bad with a rabbit on her chest answers.
6543	They take up the armchair.
6544	The armchair is shoved into the back of a car.
6545	SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a note and she beams.
6546	SOMEONE brown and yellow sports kit.
6547	SOMEONE's sitting in the armchair on his front lawn.
6548	On a rug, a posse of runners in brown and yellow come by.
6549	SOMEONE lowers her eyes.
6550	Beneath his yellow sweatband, SOMEONE's eyes cross and what little color there was in his pale cheeks washes away.
6551	SOMEONE blinks happily.
6552	SOMEONE swallows.
6553	A thin smile flashes across SOMEONE's heart-shaped face and she cuts a pipe between her teeth.
6554	She gets on her bike and rides off, leaving SOMEONE clutching his sandwich.
6555	SOMEONE cycles up to Dancing Elk School.
6556	She parks her bike and secures it with a chain lock.
6557	She makes her way past the oncoming throng of students, most of them taller than her, and reaches her locker.
6558	The locker door is plastered with photos and cuttings.
6559	She pulls out a folder and some pages fall to the floor as a boy comes by.
6560	SOMEONE grins at her friend talking to a fat bearded teacher.
6561	In class, SOMEONE swallows some Tic Tacs as SOMEONE appears by his side clutching her folders.
6562	Another boy stands on the other side of the work table.
6563	A second girl turns up.
6564	SOMEONE leaves SOMEONE open mouth.
6565	SOMEONE suppresses a smile.
6566	Later, SOMEONE dials a number.
6567	She vigorously shakes the phone and something falls out.
6568	She frowns at the phone.
6569	SOMEONE throws up in a decorative urn.
6570	SOMEONE's little sister sprinkles her food.
6571	Liberty Bell smiles slowly.
6572	SOMEONE plods away past SOMEONE.
6573	SOMEONE stops in her tracks.
6574	She shrugs and walks on towards the door of the Women Now Center.
6575	A punk girl sits in reception playing on her game console.
6576	SOMEONE wanders into the lobby and steps up to the counter.
6577	SOMEONE nods obediently.
6578	SOMEONE takes the questionnaire clipboard to a padded leather bench and sits down.
6579	As she starts to fill in the form, she becomes aware of a black woman seated nearby crumbing her fingers against her clipboard.
6580	A woman painting her nails, another scratching her arm, another using a nail file add to the crescendo of sound.
6581	SOMEONE drops her pen.
6582	SOMEONE brightens.
6583	They sit on a park bench scouring the paper.
6584	SOMEONE hands pipe smoking SOMEONE an ad.
6585	SOMEONE is lying on his bed, looking at the photo of SOMEONE in his yearbook.
6586	His other hand is clasped around a piece of cloth.
6587	SOMEONE's solidly built double-chinned mother closes the door of his bedroom.
6588	He goes back to gazing at SOMEONE's picture and brings his class pen from behind his head.
6589	Scrunched in his fingers, he is holding the knickers she wore and discarded on the day they had sex.
6590	At SOMEONE's house, SOMEONE watches apprehensively as SOMEONE paces in front of her dad and her step mom.
6591	People brace themselves.
6592	SOMEONE looks them both in the eye.
6593	SOMEONE pulls a face.
6594	SOMEONE meets her dad's bewildered gaze, then lets her head drop for a second before speaking.
6595	SOMEONE shakes his head as she turns on her heels and hightails upstairs with SOMEONE behind her.
6596	He runs his hands over his face.
6597	A slim young woman arranges some white hydrangeas in a glass vase.
6598	White cuffed hands straightens a glass photo frame.
6599	She places some aromatic sticks into a bottle.
6600	SOMEONE with SOMEONE beside him drives his blue Previa through the gates of the affluent looking Glacial Valley estate.
6601	With a ring on the fourth finger of her left hand, fans out the display of coffee table magazines, straightens two monogram tan towels, and wipes a banister rail as SOMEONE drives past a number of substantial houses set back from the road.
6602	He slows down in front of one house with a triple garage and box tree on the front lawn and pulls up onto the driveway.
6603	As the woman carefully adjust the buttons on her pristine white cuffs, people wearing everyday casual clothes stroll up to the double-fronted door flanked by two slim furs.
6604	SOMEONE wipes his feet on the doormat.
6605	The woman with neatly combed long dark hair opens the door with a bright smile.
6606	SOMEONE's slaps SOMEONE's profit hand.
6607	SOMEONE purses her lips.
6608	SOMEONE looks penetratingly at SOMEONE.
6609	On the staircase, SOMEONE in her loose checked shirt over jeans passes a lineup of post photos of people in white.
6610	She wonders into SOMEONE's en suite bathroom and contemplates herself in the large mirror above the basin, smoothing the front of her hair.
6611	There are several expensive looking bottles and jars grouped around the basin, next to a white orchid in a pot.
6612	Opening one jar, she scoops out a finger full of cream and damps it on her face.
6613	Then does a bodybuilder type snarl and pose.
6614	Picking up a bottle of perfume, she sniffs it and sprays her wrist, rubbing it against the other wrist.
6615	As she comes out of the bathroom, she collides with SOMEONE.
6616	Her eye lights on the guitar.
6617	SOMEONE points to some apparatus.
6618	SOMEONE smiles proudly.
6619	SOMEONE's attempted conversation is met with a baffled look.
6620	Then, he and both women look up towards the sound drifting down from the floor above.
6621	With a brittle smile, tall slim SOMEONE hurries upstairs to find people duetting on guitars.
6622	SOMEONE is looking at some forms.
6623	SOMEONE closes the front door with a wry smile.
6624	SOMEONE presses her hands together as if in prayer and lets him fold her in his arms.
6625	SOMEONE speeds up leaving SOMEONE alone on the running track.
6626	Two boys pass him as he slows to a walk.
6627	At school, a grey head starkly built woman in a mauve cardigan sits behind the desk looking disapprovingly at SOMEONE bulging.
6628	The woman grudgingly signs a pink form and hands it to SOMEONE.
6629	SOMEONE smiles sweetly and comes out into the corridor.
6630	A technician spreads gel across SOMEONE's distended belly with an ultrasound scan head.
6631	On a monitor next to her, SOMEONE watches moving patches of light and dark take on a recognizable shape.
6632	People sigh with delight.
6633	SOMEONE's lips tighten.
6634	With a look that could kill, the ultrasound technician leaves the room.
6635	In her room, with its walls covered in drawings, SOMEONE lies on her bed, her legs propped up on cushions, gazing at the ultrasound print.
6636	She blinks thoughtfully and moments later is driving SOMEONE's blue Previa out to Glacial Valley estate past its immaculate houses and lawns blanketed in snow.
6637	As she runs up to the Lorings' front door, she smoothes down the hem of the skirt she wears over her jeans.
6638	She peers in through one of the two oval leaded windows.
6639	She shows SOMEONE the image.
6640	SOMEONE seems to lose himself in the music, then he looks at SOMEONE.
6641	SOMEONE notices a VHS.
6642	He snatches the tape from her and they watch the film.
6643	A sinister man drives a stake through a woman's stomach.
6644	SOMEONE shows SOMEONE the picture.
6645	SOMEONE studies the image lengthwise and sideways.
6646	SOMEONE looks across at SOMEONE, who shrugs brutally.
6647	SOMEONE stands with her arms tightly folded.
6648	He places SOMEONE's bag over her shoulder and opens the door to let her out.
6649	SOMEONE gives her husband a tight smile.
6650	It's dark by the time SOMEONE arrives home, sipping from a drinks carton.
6651	SOMEONE is cutting out pictures of dogs.
6652	As SOMEONE goes back to her paper dogs, SOMEONE pours the dregs of her drink into SOMEONE's ornament.
6653	Outside, on the snowy street, SOMEONE stops the Previa and eases off her grey overskirt.
6654	SOMEONE's mother opens her front door.
6655	SOMEONE races up the stairs outrunning SOMEONE's mothers and getting to SOMEONE's room before her.
6656	SOMEONE reaches for a box.
6657	SOMEONE eases herself into a chair with her legs apart.
6658	She slides onto the floor next to him.
6659	They both look away awkwardly.
6660	SOMEONE suddenly looks glum.
6661	At her home, SOMEONE, in an old T-shirt, her hair pulled back in a pony tail, stands before a bare wall.
6662	SOMEONE, standing next to her, arms folded, looks glum.
6663	Playing nervously with the chain around her neck, SOMEONE turns to the wall behind her.
6664	SOMEONE stares bleakly at the wall.
6665	People are in the mall.
6666	They crouch down behind a glass balcony.
6667	SOMEONE is joking around with a friend's little girl in the mall play area.
6668	SOMEONE sucks in her cheeks.
6669	She stands up and looks elsewhere, but SOMEONE stays where she is, gazing down at SOMEONE playing with the little girl.
6670	A soft smile spreads across SOMEONE's face.
6671	They walk into SOMEONE.
6672	SOMEONE shakes her head in awe.
6673	SOMEONE winces.
6674	SOMEONE plants SOMEONE's hand on her belly.
6675	SOMEONE shakes her head.
6676	SOMEONE's beautiful sculpted face tightens self- consciously.
6677	Then, she drops to her knees in front of SOMEONE.
6678	and with a nervous glance about her She places her hands on SOMEONE's belly.
6679	Her eyes widen excitedly.
6680	SOMEONE, standing over her, watches her with a mixture of fondness and pride, as SOMEONE gazes at the swollen belly like a love struck puppy.
6681	SOMEONE, at the sewing machine, cuts the top of a pair of jeans and sews on an elasticated band.
6682	She gives a satisfied smile as she tests the elastic.
6683	SOMEONE, wearing the adapted jeans, comes down the school.
6684	Her hands long in the pockets of her baggy tartan parker.
6685	Her fellow students, staring at her belly, clear a path to let her pass.
6686	SOMEONE's at home composing.
6687	In the school canteen, the two girls eat their lunch in an empty school awards booth.
6688	SOMEONE gazes adoringly at the tubby bearded teacher.
6689	At his locker, SOMEONE knocks back.
6690	SOMEONE waddles up to him and looks him straight in the eye.
6691	SOMEONE's eye shift.
6692	He glances in SOMEONE's direction.
6693	SOMEONE's head drops miserably.
6694	She strides away with her canvas bag over her shoulder, leaving SOMEONE standing by his locker, watching her glumly.
6695	SOMEONE hoists herself up into her dad's Previa.
6696	She puts on some lip balm and starts the engine.
6697	SOMEONE, surfing on his PC, sees the blue van pull up outside.
6698	She follows him downstairs.
6699	He leads her into a cluttered basement room.
6700	She reads a title.
6701	Her hands grab his waist.
6702	He brings the up to his neck.
6703	With his hands round her waist, her belly touching his, she closes her eyes and rests her head on his chest, as they slowly sway together.
6704	SOMEONE, with his chin brushing against her hair, seems unsettled.
6705	SOMEONE looks up startled.
6706	SOMEONE stares at him in bewilderment.
6707	SOMEONE, loaded down with shopping, comes into her pristine white kitchen.
6708	SOMEONE lowers his gaze.
6709	SOMEONE starts to go.
6710	SOMEONE bolts out of the door.
6711	Clutching her belly she waddles out to the Previa.
6712	SOMEONE, in his rock T-shirt, over a long sleeved undershirt looks coldly at SOMEONE and goes back to his room.
6713	SOMEONE sinks down on the stairs and gazes unhappily into space.
6714	Beneath a cloudy sky, SOMEONE drives under a road bridge, passing a freight train on one side.
6715	She pulls off the main carriage way onto the soft shoulder, next to a sward of dull green grass dotted with patches of spring snow.
6716	She runs her hand over her own belly as she gives into tears.
6717	Crammed in, behind the wheel, SOMEONE seems oblivious of the passing cars as she rubs her belly under her thick tartan coat.
6718	Her eyes stare straight ahead, not looking at anything in particular.
6719	And she starts to calm down.
6720	The car lights flash and she pulls back on to the road and drives off.
6721	Up in his room, SOMEONE is playing his guitar.
6722	It's after dark.
6723	 On the bonnet of the van, her head resting on the sloping front windscreen, with her hands tuck behind her back staring up at the sky.
6724	She suddenly raises herself onto her elbows and climbs back into the van.
6725	She rummages behind her and finds a crumpled receipt.
6726	She smoothes it out on the steering wheel of the van and starts to write on it.
6727	In her immaculate house, SOMEONE is sitting alone at the dining room table, sipping a glass of red wine.
6728	SOMEONE comes downstairs.
6729	He comes towards her and pulls up a chair.
6730	A faintly smug smile flickers across his face.
6731	SOMEONE, opening the front door, catches sight of SOMEONE driving off.
6732	At his feet, he finds the note she left.
6733	SOMEONE grabs it from him and they both read it.
6734	SOMEONE parks the Previa in the street outside the family's wooden slatted house, where the porch light illuminates a straw heart hanging on the door knocker.
6735	She gets out of the vehicle looking emotionally and physically exhausted.
6736	In the front garden, she stops to pick a crocus and with a solemn expression traces a circle across her tummy with its petal.
6737	Her mustachio dad, his bald head gleaning in the bright kitchen light, is busy fixing something at the kitchen table as she comes in.
6738	She flops down at the table.
6739	He stares at her belly.
6740	SOMEONE nods wryly, then her expression brightens.
6741	SOMEONE smiles to himself and carries on tinkering.
6742	Through the slats, on SOMEONE's upstairs window blinds, people can be seen scouring to the Previa.
6743	Next morning, as the track team run past his house, SOMEONE comes out of the front door.
6744	He opens the mailbox and a of orange Tic Tac packs cascade onto his feet.
6745	He grins in delight.
6746	The running team sprint around the track.
6747	SOMEONE breaks off as he spots SOMEONE coming towards him past a lineup a cheerleaders rehearsing their routine.
6748	Smiling, he jogs to meet her.
6749	She takes his hand and places it on her tummy with her hands clasping his.
6750	Their eyes lock and he smiles.
6751	With his hands in the pockets of his brown sweatshirt, over his skimpy yellow shorts, he kisses her.
6752	And standing on tiptoes, SOMEONE cups his face.
6753	Her secret admirer watches sullenly and SOMEONE, doing stretching exercises, grins.
6754	SOMEONE gives her the finger, keeping her lips firmly stuck to SOMEONE's lips.
6755	Later, she drives a matchbox police car up over the crest of her enormous belly.
6756	The little car slips from her grasp and she rolls her eyes.
6757	People come hurtling out of the front door with Liberty Belly in her ballet outfit.
6758	In the hospital, SOMEONE jokingly steers SOMEONE's wheelchair into a gown trolley.
6759	In the birthing suite, people and the midwife keep their eyes fixed firmly on SOMEONE.
6760	A squawking baby attached to his umbilical cord.
6761	SOMEONE takes a long look at him, then closes her eyes.
6762	SOMEONE breaks the tape.
6763	He looks round for her.
6764	He runs up the steps of the stand and away.
6765	In the hospital room, SOMEONE is gently stroking SOMEONE's hair as she lies on her side in bed.
6766	She nods sleepily.
6767	They both turn to the door and SOMEONE's face lights up.
6768	SOMEONE stands in the doorway.
6769	SOMEONE gets to his feet and kisses SOMEONE on the forehead.
6770	At the doorway, he looks SOMEONE straight in the eye and lightly squeezes him by the shoulders, then goes.
6771	SOMEONE comes round to the other side of the bed and pulls off his yellow sweatband.
6772	He crawls on the bed next to SOMEONE, wrapping his arm across her chest, cupping her hand in his.
6773	She starts to sob.
6774	A nurse comes to the door of the maternity ward and smiles at SOMEONE, who's looking in through a window.
6775	A porcelain white face looking nervous, SOMEONE follows the nurse into the ward and stands over one.
6776	The nurse picks the baby up and hands him to her.
6777	SOMEONE appears in the doorway and smiles approvingly.
6778	SOMEONE gazes into the baby's face and beams.
6779	SOMEONE, wearing her birthing gown and her striped woolen socks and SOMEONE in his sports kit and trainers held up like to spoons on the bed.
6780	SOMEONE starts to smile through her tears.
6781	An antique rocking chair in the baby's nursery.
6782	Above the white cup, the note SOMEONE scribbled is mounted in a white frame on the pale yellow painted wall.
6783	SOMEONE, sitting up in bed, her baby in her arms, gazes solemnly into his upturn face.
6784	She strokes the soft downy hair above his ear and cups his head in her hand.
6785	Trees are bursting with blossom as the track team jogged down a winding path.
6786	SOMEONE is sitting on the front lawn bouncing two Weimaraner pups on her lap.
6787	Smiling SOMEONE, back to her slim self, pushes her bike out onto the pavement with a guitar over her shoulder.
6788	She rides down a quiet residential street in bright sunlight.
6789	She arrives at SOMEONE's house and props her bike against the front wall.
6790	SOMEONE is sitting on the low wall with his guitar on his lap.
6791	SOMEONE sits down facing him with her guitar.
6792	The sit facing each other in the sunshine in front of SOMEONE's gable fronted house.
6793	SOMEONE stands up and plants a kiss on SOMEONE's lips, just as the track team come jogging by.
6794	The pictures snaps to black.
6795	People are reflected in the mirror of a shop changing room, peering in nervously.
6796	SOMEONE sits beside a black woman who's lying down, gazing into a blanket wrapped bundle.
6797	The women smiles at the wriggling bundle.
6798	The doctor gently lifts the bundle and looks inside.
6799	Still reflected in the mirror, the doctor looks up at the saleswoman.
6800	The doctor looks back at the baby, frowning.
6801	A man is leaning against a train window, staring out as the train pulls away from a station.
6802	The man straightens up and leans back in his seat.
6803	He is wearing a dark gray suit.
6804	The top button of his pale green shirt is undone.
6805	His tie loosely knotted.
6806	The little hair he has is close shaved, leaving just a dark shadow.
6807	Glancing between the seats in front of him, he sees a little girl lying almost upside down, staring back at him.
6808	He grins at her.
6809	The grin fades, and he leans towards the window again.
6810	He rubs the inside corner of one eye wearily.
6811	A slim women in her late 20s, wearing a blue top, stretches up to place her coat on the overhead rack.
6812	As she does, the top parts company with her black trousers, and the man gazes at her exposed white midriff and the section of ivy tattoo climbing through the gap between top and trousers.
6813	He flirtively slips off his wedding ring and drops it into his jacket pocket.
6814	The young woman sits down, glances at some leaflets, drops them in the seat pocket, straightens her shoulder-length brown hair, tucks down her top, sits back, and closes her eyes.
6815	The man looks down at the seat pocket in front of him, stretches forward, and picks up a magazine.
6816	The man picks up the second magazine, and looks at him himself before passing it to her.
6817	The man looks down, swallows, and looks at her again.
6818	He watches another train pass and looks down before turning to her again.
6819	Shake hands.
6820	She looks down at the magazine again.
6821	She looks up, her smile gone, folds and unfolds her arms, tucks her fist under her chin, shows him her wedding ring.
6822	She stands, picks up the leaflets, and moves down the aisle of the train.
6823	His head drops.
6824	He pulls his wedding ring from his pocket, hesitates for a moment before slipping it back on, and settles back in his seat.
6825	Glancing between the seat backs, SOMEONE sees a little girl in front sitting up now.
6826	Her blonde hair pulled off her face and held by yellow clips watching him and smiling.
6827	He moves out of her sight towards the window and leans against it frowning slightly.
6828	His eyes close.
6829	Outside, trees and shrubs form a green backdrop along the track side.
6830	SOMEONE's eyes open.
6831	Outside, the greenery is becoming a blur.
6832	The train is moving faster, shaking more than it did.
6833	He watches through the window.
6834	He glances across the aisle.
6835	A man reading a book closes it and, like the woman beside him, begins to stare out of the window as the train begins to shake more violently.
6836	SOMEONE looks up ahead.
6837	Between the seats, he sees another passenger's hand reaching down to grab hold of an armrest.
6838	A car is driving down a quite urban street.
6839	In a living room, a boy is lies over a sofa, his feet over the back, his head hanging down to the floor, flicking through TV channels with the remote, upside down.
6840	SOMEONE slowly swings his legs over the side of a hospital trolley and sits up.
6841	In front of him, a white bandaged figure is lying on another trolley.
6842	Dressed only in his shirt and trousers, SOMEONE looks around uncertainly.
6843	A white coated man carrying a clipboard, who has been standing by the other figure, walks towards SOMEONE and is replaced by other medical staff.
6844	He holds up a torch.
6845	He examines SOMEONE's eyes.
6846	SOMEONE stares at the other trolley.
6847	They both look at the person on the other trolley, whose chest is heaving unevenly.
6848	Still staring at the other figure, SOMEONE slowly shakes his head.
6849	SOMEONE shakes his head again, watching a crimson stain slowly seeping through the bandages of the other passenger.
6850	SOMEONE nods abstractedly as the crimson stain quickly spreads.
6851	The other body heaves as blood forms a pool on top of the bandages.
6852	SOMEONE walks stiffly down a hospital corridor lined with silent people standing, sitting, leaning against walls, many of them watching him and smiling.
6853	His son sees him, jumps up from the bench, and runs to him.
6854	SOMEONE hugs his son to his chest, gives him a slight smile, and looks over his head at the slim fair-haired woman who has followed the boy.
6855	They stare at each other.
6856	She moves forward and puts her head on his shoulder, his cheek against her hair.
6857	He puts his arm around her, gazing past her.
6858	She steps back, looks at SOMEONE, then at the boy, her head on one side.
6859	The boy's lips move.
6860	The three of them stand silently for a moment.
6861	Then the boy takes the woman's hand and puts it in his father's before setting off down the corridor.
6862	As his parents follow, they let go of each others hands.
6863	A gaggle of reporters and photographers, one holding a long boom microphone, are standing inside the big double doors at the end of the corridor.
6864	Flashlights go off as SOMEONE's family steps out in the open air.
6865	SOMEONE's sitting alone at the table in a small dimly lit kitchen.
6866	He is staring down at the spoon he is holding against the rim of a cereal bowl.
6867	He nods slightly as he brings the spoon under control.
6868	He walks down the hall past an open doorway and starts to go upstairs.
6869	From inside the room, his wife looks up at him.
6870	He stops and looks down at her.
6871	She is standing in front of open drawer.
6872	She drops her eyes momentarily, looks up again, gently.
6873	He continues upstairs.
6874	SOMEONE, in a gray jacket, walks past a large sign reading Memorial Service for the families of East Rail Train 177.
6875	In the church, a priest stands in the pulpit.
6876	By the pulpit, photos cover a large board.
6877	Outside the church, SOMEONE heads towards his car.
6878	He stops and looks at the windscreen, walks to it, and takes an envelope from under the windscreen wiper.
6879	He turns the envelope over, frowning, before flicking open the unsealed flap.
6880	He stands looking at the card for some moments before turning and gazing back at the church.
6881	In a locker room, SOMEONE opens one of the chipped green doors.
6882	He stops in the doorway of an office and takes off his baseball cap.
6883	A gray haired woman with gold rimmed glasses is sitting at a computer.
6884	She glances at her computer screen.
6885	She picks up a pen.
6886	She makes a note and puts down the pen, still without looking at him.
6887	She returns to her work, still ignoring him.
6888	He pulls on his baseball cap and goes.
6889	A cape hooded figure stands motionless in an archway silhouetted black against the teeming rain.
6890	He is watching an american football training session.
6891	One player suddenly erupts into a sprint, sidestepping opponents without losing speed.
6892	He captures the ball thrown from behind and dives over the line.
6893	He tosses the ball to another player and trots back again.
6894	Protected from the rain by the hood of his cape, SOMEONE sighs deeply.
6895	In the locker room, SOMEONE towels his head and face.
6896	He puts his towel away and glances to his right.
6897	An older man is in the doorway.
6898	SOMEONE stares at the locker door, and then glances at SOMEONE.
6899	In a darkened room, a hand reaches out and switches on a bedside lamp.
6900	SOMEONE, head on a pillow, looks sideways at his son who's sleeping peacefully.
6901	A clock on the other side of the bed says a quarter to one.
6902	SOMEONE stands at his wife's closed door.
6903	SOMEONE frowns and shakes her head.
6904	From blackout, a fuzzy grayness takes the shape of a sling holding the arm of a black boy.
6905	He is sitting in a strangely hazy living room, a photo on the wall behind, a corner table with a lamp on it.
6906	The boy's mouth turns down, and he sulks silently, staring blankly ahead.
6907	Behind him the door opens, and a woman enters.
6908	She pauses, hands on hips, then walks towards him.
6909	They are both reflected in the curved screen of an old TV, so the edges of the room look distorted.
6910	She stands beside him, arms folded.
6911	The woman crouches beside the boy, looking into his face.
6912	The boy turns and looks at her.
6913	She stands and folds her arms again.
6914	He is hunched forward, head down.
6915	The boy lifts his head.
6916	The boy goes to the window.
6917	Outside in the sunshine, children are playing in a park with a high chain link fence.
6918	An oblong box with purple wrapping is propped on the seat of a bench facing him.
6919	Chlidren chase past the bench, as the boy walks slowly towards it.
6920	Holding on to the fencing for support as he negotiates the two steps down into the park.
6921	He sits on the bench and picks up the purple package with his good right hand, undoes the white ribbon around it, and tears at the paper.
6922	Inside is a brown cardboard box.
6923	The boy pulls off the lid, folds back purple tissue paper, and stares down.
6924	In the box is a comic, upside down.
6925	Very carefully, the boy turns the comic around on its bed of purple tissue.
6926	The cover features a heroic figure in a yellow cape fighting a powerfully built creature, half-man, half-beast, against a backdrop of New York skyscrapers.
6927	The woman sits gently beside the boy.
6928	The boy continues to stare down at the comic.
6929	She looks away and back at him.
6930	He glances up at her for a moment.
6931	As he looks down again, the words and colors fade, leaving a more detailed black and white version of the comic cover.
6932	The dark haired young man in suit and tie, whose face is reflected in the glass over the drawing, nods.
6933	The young man grins.
6934	SOMEONE limps across the gallery using a cane.
6935	SOMEONE turns back to stare at the man.
6936	As he does, SOMEONE strides towards the gallery with SOMEONE a few paces behind.
6937	Inside, SOMEONE is walking away from the door and doesn't look around.
6938	SOMEONE turns.
6939	They are sitting in an office.
6940	SOMEONE gazes up at his father.
6941	SOMEONE looks from SOMEONE to SOMEONE, then gets up and goes.
6942	SOMEONE, in a shimmering, purple, silk suit, gazes at SOMEONE.
6943	SOMEONE looks around as SOMEONE returns.
6944	SOMEONE is sitting up on a bed, a pillow behind his head, reading the paper.
6945	SOMEONE is asleep, lying across him.
6946	His head on SOMEONE's chest.
6947	One arm flung around him.
6948	SOMEONE lowers the paper and glances at his son.
6949	He closes the paper, and very carefully slides out from under the sleeping boy.
6950	He opens the door to a walk-in wardrobe, switches on the bare bulb, and feels under some folded jeans on a shelf above his head.
6951	He removes a piece of gray cloth from which a gun butt protrudes.
6952	He lays the cloth on his newspaper, unwraps the stubby, black revolver, looks at it, re-wraps it, and replaces it.
6953	Feeling under the jeans again, he removes a battered folder.
6954	He opens it and flips through old newspaper clippings about American football.
6955	A photo of a young SOMEONE in football gear looks out from another story.
6956	He turns over more clippings, copies of the first stories, pages of sport results, more photos of football matches.
6957	The personalities involved disguised by their helmets and face guards, until he comes to a picture of an overturned car.
6958	He stares at it frowning.
6959	He looks back at the picture of the car, obviously, taken at night.
6960	It's lying just beyond a bend in a tree-lined road, upside down in a ditch.
6961	Its roof crushed.
6962	He glances across the room, quickly closes, and replaces the folder under his jeans.
6963	SOMEONE is outside his door.
6964	She looks down.
6965	Her face crumbles, and she pushes her fists to her mouth.
6966	He watches her turn and start down the stairs before he shuts the door.
6967	In a huge football stadium, SOMEONE is on duty holding a walkie-talkie.
6968	In a white covered walkway.
6969	People stroll beside the crowds, cuing to get in.
6970	SOMEONE brushes past a tall, slim man wearing a pale, sandy green and gray camouflage jacket.
6971	A few paces further on, he looks back, eyes narrowed.
6972	When they move on again, SOMEONE, who's wearing a long black leather coat and his usual black gloves, and walking with the help of his stick, glances back too.
6973	SOMEONE stops at the head of the queue and speaks to another security.
6974	The other guards starts frisking the fans.
6975	The man with thinning hair and a black beard looks around.
6976	People watch the slow moving queue.
6977	SOMEONE, the taller of the two, but stooping leaning on his stick.
6978	The suspect reaches a break in the metal barriers, steps out of the queue, hand covering his mouth, walks away against the flow of fans.
6979	SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE, then away again.
6980	SOMEONE grins at SOMEONE.
6981	SOMEONE looks away again, and nods.
6982	SOMEONE holds up his walkie-talkie.
6983	SOMEONE walks along the dark corridor.
6984	SOMEONE's glass walking stick lands on the seat of his car.
6985	The man in the camouflage jacket walks past the car.
6986	SOMEONE hobbles around the arched colonnade that encircles the stadium.
6987	Through alternate pools of light and shadows cast by the arches but the man walks fast enough to disappear from sight around the curve of the building.
6988	Staring around anxiously, SOMEONE spots the man on the other side of the road from the dark brick built stadium.
6989	The man striding down into the subway.
6990	SOMEONE waits for a car to pass and crosses the road against the traffic lights.
6991	The skirt of his coat flapping open to reveal a purple lining.
6992	He almost skips across the street in his anxiety.
6993	Grabbing the handrail to steady himself and silhouetted against the daylight, he stares down the long steep staircase at the man striding into the tiled station.
6994	SOMEONE watches the man disappear into the station, looks down, and launches himself down the stairs.
6995	Using his stick and hanging onto the rail, SOMEONE tries to stay balanced, but his feet don't land accurately.
6996	He slips.
6997	His glass stick flies downwards.
6998	He is sprawled on the stairs on his back, head downwards.
6999	Looking upside down into the station, he sees the man glance back before vaulting the ticket barrier.
7000	As the man's jacket flips up, SOMEONE sees under it a silver gun with a black grip.
7001	His eyes flicker and close.
7002	A sunny afternoon, a white bus stops on a hill at a suburban street, and SOMEONE gets out still in his security uniform of green jacket and maroon cap and carrying a holdall.
7003	He turns and walks slowly and smiling towards a small green park where a group of boys are playing American football on the grass.
7004	SOMEONE runs up some steps to join SOMEONE, while the other children mill around a young man with a crew cut, admiring his muscles.
7005	They turn and walk away together.
7006	SOMEONE with his hand on his father's back.
7007	In the dim light of a basement, SOMEONE wearing a light grey sweatshirt is laying flat on a narrow bench, pushing up a weight's bar.
7008	He straightens his arms, lets the bar down onto a pair of supports on either side of the bench, and sits up.
7009	SOMEONE, his fringe hanging to his eyebrows, gazes down at SOMEONE, who looks around at the weights on the ends of the bar.
7010	SOMEONE looks away, walks behind SOMEONE to the weights.
7011	SOMEONE's sitting on a bench, looking down, while SOMEONE moves from one end of the bar to the other.
7012	He lies back on the bench and grips the bar.
7013	He lifts it off the supports, frowning, and lowers it to his chest.
7014	As he starts to push it up, his mouth contorts with effort, and a large vein stands out on his forehead from between his eyes up into his scalp.
7015	His arms quiver, and his head trembles as he lowers the bar to his chest and pushes it up again.
7016	He reaches full arm extension and drops the bar back onto the supports.
7017	He sits up.
7018	SOMEONE puts his head on one side quizzically.
7019	He turns to see the weights on the ends of the bar, and SOMEONE walks up to him.
7020	SOMEONE twists around to look at the other end of the bar.
7021	SOMEONE watches tensely.
7022	SOMEONE takes several paces back towards an open covered door.
7023	On the bench, SOMEONE grips his hands out wider than his shoulders and takes the weight.
7024	He drops the bar slowly to his chest and pushes up until his arms are straight.
7025	He lowers the bar again and again straightens his arms, while SOMEONE stares.
7026	Finally, SOMEONE drops the bar back onto the supports.
7027	SOMEONE's hands wrap around the bar slowly feeling for the optimum grip.
7028	Even more weights have been clamped to the bar this time.
7029	SOMEONE's frowning slightly.
7030	SOMEONE's standing in the cupboard.
7031	On his bench, SOMEONE braces himself.
7032	He lowers the bar to his chest.
7033	Arms quivering, eyes tight shut, face twisted, he presses it up to full extension.
7034	He repeats the press and replaces the bar.
7035	Above the bar, SOMEONE's white face appears upside down to SOMEONE.
7036	SOMEONE's standing two steps up the staircase.
7037	As the bar rises, two big paint cans appear taped to it next to the weights.
7038	SOMEONE drops the bar back in its supports.
7039	His left arm flops to the floor.
7040	With his right still gripping the bar, he holds himself upright.
7041	SOMEONE comes down the stairs.
7042	He walks slowly over to SOMEONE, who twists around to inspect the weights and the paint cans at either end of the bar.
7043	SOMEONE's brow furrows.
7044	SOMEONE gazes at him in awe.
7045	SOMEONE is lying in a hospital bed.
7046	SOMEONE nods almost imperceptibly.
7047	Inside, SOMEONE is sorting through papers on a reception desk.
7048	A nurse approaches her.
7049	The nurse points across the room.
7050	SOMEONE hands the nurse a yellow file, takes another one from her, and walks across the open plan office.
7051	She leans through a doorway and smiles.
7052	Sitting on a low couch in a treatment room.
7053	She looks up at SOMEONE who's watching her from his wheelchair.
7054	Metal frame keeps his right leg straight.
7055	The street outside the stadium is empty.
7056	Inside, along one of the shaded walkways, SOMEONE, in his security uniformis leaning on a wall, casually watching spectators as they crowd in through a gate.
7057	He looks away and stares at the ground.
7058	After a moment, he pushes himself off the wall and moves to the center of the walkway and stands there with his head down and his hands in his pockets.
7059	The crowd streams past him, laughing and smiling.
7060	They jostle and bump him.
7061	Some almost pushing him aside, but he doesn't react.
7062	A large woman in a pink coat, blonde hair hanging over her shoulders, dragging a small boy by the hand, bangs into him.
7063	SOMEONE turns slowly and looks after her.
7064	SOMEONE is still talking to SOMEONE.
7065	In the stadium, SOMEONE is standing motionless in the center of the walkway.
7066	He turns slowly, frowning, not really looking at the crowds.
7067	A young man in a bright, blue anorak bumps into him.
7068	In the toilets, another young man in a red and blue anorak wrapped half of his shoulders, washes his hands.
7069	He turns away from the basin looks towards the door and he is alone.
7070	Reaching inside a waist bin, he extracts a small package, slips it into his trouser pocket and, hitching up his anorak, walks slowly out.
7071	In the walkway, SOMEONE watches the man in the bright blue anorak join a queue for tickets and approaches him.
7072	The man looks at SOMEONE and slowly turns to face him.
7073	The man lifts his arms, and SOMEONE pats his clothes.
7074	He puts a hand into one anorak pocket, rummaging around, but comes out with nothing.
7075	He steps back.
7076	The man looks at him wearily.
7077	SOMEONE swallows and nods.
7078	The man turns away.
7079	SOMEONE watches him, sighs, and turns to walk in the other direction.
7080	SOMEONE pulls out his walkie-talkie.
7081	SOMEONE frowns and looks back at the man in the anorak, who is also watching him.
7082	The man quickly looks away.
7083	SOMEONE's eyes are on SOMEONE, who's sitting opposite a white haired woman at a table.
7084	Next to SOMEONE, sits a boy with a thermometer in his mouth.
7085	SOMEONE nods.
7086	SOMEONE looks pityingly at the other boy.
7087	SOMEONE shakes his head.
7088	SOMEONE shakes his head again.
7089	Another head shake.
7090	SOMEONE swallows, his eyes fixed on the woman.
7091	SOMEONE stares.
7092	He and SOMEONE are outside.
7093	They are humbling through the playground across the colored markings for hopscotch.
7094	SOMEONE shakes his head.
7095	Dusk is falling in the street outside their house.
7096	In the kitchen, SOMEONE's at the sink, washing up.
7097	SOMEONE puts down a pan and stops, starring at SOMEONE, whose sitting at a table, with SOMEONE's gun in front of him.
7098	SOMEONE picks up the gun.
7099	SOMEONE holds the gun in both hands, pointing it at SOMEONE.
7100	The gun lands on the table.
7101	SOMEONE grabs it and quickly removes the bullets, while SOMEONE collapses, leaning on the table, head in hands.
7102	SOMEONE bangs the unloaded gun on the cooker, slides down the wall, and sits slumped against it.
7103	SOMEONE collapses onto the floor.
7104	In the limited edition gallery.
7105	He stares down at the carpet in the sliver-gey room.
7106	Street and shop lights glare in the grey evening as people wait to cross a busy junction.
7107	In a shop, SOMEONE is motionless, glowering and sullen in his wheelchair.
7108	The walls are covered with comics individually wrapped in plastic covers which reflect the light.
7109	The stock keeper man looks up from behind a counter at the far end of the shop.
7110	He peers toward SOMEONE.
7111	He puts something away, walks out from the counter, and heads down the aisle towards SOMEONE.
7112	He has thick, curly hair, wears black jeans and a black Motorhead T-shirt.
7113	He stops halfway down the aisle.
7114	SOMEONE's playing with two toy figures, a caped superhero and a green reptilian villain.
7115	SOMEONE joins SOMEONE, watching their son.
7116	SOMEONE who's been leaning on the wall behind SOMEONE, unfolds his arms and puts his hands in his pockets.
7117	He looks at SOMEONE.
7118	In the shop the assistant peers down at SOMEONE.
7119	His head sways from side to side, looking for a reaction.
7120	Finally, he walks around to the back of SOMEONE's chair, takes the handles, and starts to wheel it down the aisle, maneuvering carefully between the heavily stacked shelves and displays.
7121	Suddenly, SOMEONE wrenches a wheel and the chair slews into a display.
7122	Magazines fall from the display.
7123	The assistant looks at SOMEONE as if about to speak, his hands moving feebly.
7124	SOMEONE, slumped in his chair, ignores him.
7125	The assistant starts pushing again until SOMEONE wrenches the other wheel.
7126	The assistant steps back, raising his hands as if in surrender.
7127	He looks down at SOMEONE, who still stares sullenly ahead.
7128	They set off again between the racks of comics and related toys.
7129	The assistant leaves SOMEONE by the display he is run into.
7130	His hand, protected by a padded black mitten, carefully lifts it up.
7131	The cover shows a powerfully built hero in blue, racing towards a gaggle of shadowy demonic figures.
7132	He holds it out towards the assistant who's at the counter on the telephone.
7133	People are sitting at a bar, facing each other.
7134	They gaze at each other, very still.
7135	The babysitter.
7136	SOMEONE gives the girl money.
7137	She turns toward the door and sees the rain streaming down the window.
7138	She throws a little brown jacket over her hair and leaves.
7139	SOMEONE runs his hand over his head.
7140	SOMEONE leans against the pillar at the foot of the stairs.
7141	She looks at him, one hand holding his coat, the other in his pocket.
7142	She nods, turns, and goes.
7143	He throws his coat over the back of the sofa.
7144	The green light on the answering machine flashes in a dark room.
7145	SOMEONE walks in from the unlit landing and presses a button.
7146	Headlights blaze through the teeming rain.
7147	The car stops before a chain link fence.
7148	The driver's door opens and a caped and hooded figure walks to the fence.
7149	He looks to his left, stands for a moment, a black shape against the headlights, hesitates, then grasps at links above his head and begins to climb.
7150	A high door swings open, and the caped figure stand in the entrance of a warehouse.
7151	He looks around.
7152	Silver-grey light from the rows of small windows glows on strange objects.
7153	To his left, beyond a set of stairs, two looming shapes appear and become recognizable as the ends of two train carriages, slightly bent and twisted.
7154	The man walks to the nearer of the two, not badly damaged at the back.
7155	As he looks up at the length of it, however, he sees that the sides have been smashed open.
7156	The little remaining glass is cracked and shattered.
7157	Seats lean drunkenly, having been torn from their mountings, their upholstery charred and blackened.
7158	Light catches the man's face as he stares up at the wrecked carriage.
7159	He stands quite still, looking up, grim faced, for a long time, ignoring drops of water falling from his hood.
7160	In the dark, a man is crouching on a force.
7161	He rises onto his knees.
7162	As his head comes up, light falls on the face of SOMEONE, aged about 20.
7163	He looks around.
7164	The light is coming from a burning car, upside down behind him.
7165	He staggers towards it, stumbling on his knees, crawling.
7166	A young woman lies in the burning car, unconscious.
7167	SOMEONE is lying very still.
7168	SOMEONE grasps the edge of the car door with both hands and pulls.
7169	He bends down and checks the door catch, which doesn't move.
7170	SOMEONE's arm is hanging out of the window.
7171	SOMEONE grabs the edge of the door again and heaves.
7172	Beyond him, flames rise up into the night sky.
7173	He rips the door from its hinges, bends down, and releases SOMEONE's seat belt.
7174	SOMEONE drags SOMEONE from the car, cradles her in his arms, and lays her down gently some yards away.
7175	He looks over his shoulder and sees the lights of a pickup truck coming slowly around the bend.
7176	He waves frantically.
7177	When he looks back, SOMEONE's eyes are open.
7178	He holds her head, tenderly.
7179	The truck driver runs to them.
7180	SOMEONE looks into the man's concerned face, and back at SOMEONE.
7181	Very slowly, he lifts his head, the flames still flickering behind him.
7182	He has a thoughtful expression on his face and doesn't meet the man's eyes.
7183	SOMEONE rolls his wheelchair along a darkened corridor, his right leg still sticking straight out with its two long rows of shiny bolts protruding from the metal frame around it.
7184	He picks up the phone.
7185	SOMEONE looks straight ahead, past the rows of shelving, displaying a huge collection of comics.
7186	SOMEONE is standing at the top of the stairs above the the concourse of Philadelphia Train Station.
7187	On either side of him, tall classical stone pillars.
7188	Directly ahead, the enormous, bright disk of the station clock.
7189	In the beams of cold silver light from lamps high above in the ceiling, people scurry across the concourse.
7190	Uniformly grey against the grey floor and walls, SOMEONE descends the stone staircase.
7191	He stands at the foot of the stairs in a baseball cap and his rain cape, watching humanity ebb and flow.
7192	He starts to walk unhurriedly through the crowd.
7193	A young blonde woman in a bright red jacket bumps into him.
7194	He sees, watching from above, the same woman wearing a different shiny jacket in a jewellery shop.
7195	She points and the elderly assistant, and while his back is turned, reaches over the counter, takes a bracelet, and drops it into her bag.
7196	SOMEONE watches her disappearing into the crowd.
7197	He moves slowly on.
7198	Other people pass him, some touching him.
7199	He stops in the middle of the concourse, people swirling around him, and holds his left hand out slightly, fingers extended.
7200	A man in a check shirt worn outside his trousers brushes into SOMEONE's extended hand.
7201	Once again, he is looking down from high above.
7202	The man in the check shirt leans out of a pickup and smashes a bottle over the head of a black woman strolling along a city street at night.
7203	Frowning, SOMEONE watches the man drain a beer can and drop it into a trash bin.
7204	A young man in a green shirt kneels by a bed.
7205	A young woman in a very short party dress is sprawled on the bed.
7206	She rolls over, unhearing, the dress revealing her thighs.
7207	The boy watches for a moment, rises, and the girl's leg slips off the bed.
7208	She is lying on her side, blonde hair spread over an assortment of coats.
7209	She isn't moving.
7210	The boy leaves, closing the door behind him.
7211	SOMEONE turns and looks around the station.
7212	A group of college students files past him, all wearing maroon baseball caps.
7213	He looks beyond them and sees the young man wearing a green jacket embrace his mother and turn to smile at his father.
7214	SOMEONE watches and starts to walk backwards, swallowing hard, and glancing at other people as they pass by.
7215	He backs into a maintenance man in orange overalls pushing a trash bin on wheels.
7216	A man opens his front door to the maintenance man now in an orange T-shirt.
7217	The two men stare at each other through the outer fly screen door.
7218	The maintenance man grabs the door.
7219	He holds the door open.
7220	SOMEONE sees an image of the house owner sprawled on the basement steps.
7221	He stares upwards for a moment, his eyes wide.
7222	Still looking shocked, he gazes around the concourse and spots the maintenance man emptying the trash can on the far side.
7223	SOMEONE follows the man as he pushes his wheelie bin around a corner and along a dimly lit corridor.
7224	A couple of people are lounging listlessly against the wall.
7225	SOMEONE stands gazing at the door, seeing shadows of people passing back and forth inside through frosted glass panels.
7226	The door opens and the maintenance man reappears, wearing a cap and with a bag slung across his body.
7227	The man walks at a steady pace along a dark street lined with cars, and up a long stairway lit by tall bright lamps on alternate sides.
7228	SOMEONE follows him with the hood of his cape up against the teeming rain.
7229	At the top of the stairs, he waits and watches.
7230	The man continues up a street on a gentle incline, where large houses are set back from the road, and turns and walks up the path to a detached house with a mature tree in the front garden.
7231	He stops in the porch, looks up and down the street, takes something from beside the porch, and disappears into the shadows around the side of the house.
7232	SOMEONE drops his head, staring down at the ground.
7233	The shadow from his hood obscures all his space but a triangle from his nose to his mouth.
7234	He lifts his head and looks towards the house.
7235	Two strips of light appear and very slowly widen as a door opens.
7236	The spreading light falls on mail scattered over a tiled floor, and on clothes strewn on the floor further inside.
7237	Water drips from a cape onto a pair of shoes.
7238	SOMEONE stands silhouetted in the doorway.
7239	Lights are on inside the house.
7240	Beyond three open doorways, SOMEONE can see a staircase.
7241	He stops in the doorway, and slowly turns back.
7242	He takes a step back into a dark lobby, looking to his left, and reaches forward to open another door.
7243	He looks around and switches on a light.
7244	The house owner is lying head down on the basement steps, and SOMEONE sees again the maintenance man's violent entry into the house.
7245	SOMEONE closes the door and moves slowly into the next room, which has half paneled walls.
7246	He passes a chair at the end of a table, which suggests it's the dining room.
7247	The next room has easy chairs, a sitting room.
7248	Light from a television flickers and he glances towards it.
7249	He stops before moving into the hallway.
7250	SOMEONE's shadow grows larger on the wall at the top of the stairs as he climbs them.
7251	He peers through the crack of a partly open door.
7252	Frowning, he steps forward and pushes it open wider, and flicks on the light.
7253	He steps into a child's bedroom with pop posters on the wall.
7254	He looks across the room, past the bed, to a second door.
7255	He stands in the doorway of a bathroom, where a boy and girl, not quite teenagers, are sitting on the floor facing each other, their wrists tied above their heads.
7256	He kneels beside the boy pulling the plastic cable tying his wrists to a towel rail, light glinting on his wedding ring.
7257	The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him.
7258	He silences the pair, hand out, palm down.
7259	In another larger bedroom, plain white linen curtains flap at the open window, giving glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet.
7260	The curtains flap further apart, revealing a woman in a dressing gown, sitting on the floor, and leaning against an old fashioned black radiator.
7261	Her knees are drawn up.
7262	The gown has slipped partway up her legs.
7263	Her wrists are tied above her head and lashed to the radiator.
7264	Her head lulls on one side.
7265	From the other side of the room, SOMEONE looks down at her and puts a finger to his lips.
7266	He cross to the full length window and parts the curtains.
7267	After a moment, he steps through the curtains onto a balcony and walks to the edge, raindrops glistening on his rain cape.
7268	He leans on the rail and looks over.
7269	The maintenance man in orange launches himself at SOMEONE from inside the bedroom.
7270	SOMEONE is hurled over the balcony.
7271	He lands on his face in water.
7272	He lifts his head.
7273	The black shiny surface on which he is lying begins to crease and sag.
7274	Water forms an ever larger pool around him.
7275	He watches the rain splashing in the water in front of him as he gradually begins to sink.
7276	Over to his left, he sees a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold in on itself.
7277	More ridges ahead and to his right do the same.
7278	Behind him, as the sheeting slips inwards, he sees a glistening white surface beneath it.
7279	From above, the black plastic swimming pool cover enfolds him, wraps him up, and sinks into the dark water.
7280	Beneath the surface, blackness gives way to light from above, seen through a haze of bubbles, before the blackness closes around him again.
7281	His hands thrash in the bubbles reaching for the light.
7282	High above the water, a blurred shape in orange turns away from the balcony.
7283	Darkness and light alternate under the water as SOMEONE struggles to free himself from the embrace of the black cover.
7284	Through the bubbles, a pole appears, poking down from a blurred figure at the pool side.
7285	SOMEONE reaches for it, loses it, sees it again, and at the third attempt, grasps it.
7286	Above the pole, bright lights shine into the pool.
7287	SOMEONE struggles to the surface, clinging to the pole, lets go of it to claw his fingers over the pool edge.
7288	The pole slides away, and SOMEONE hangs on grimly for a moment before hauling himself out of the water and crawling painfully slowly away from it.
7289	The two children are standing a few paces away, drenched by the rain, watching him.
7290	The pole is lying on the ground between them.
7291	SOMEONE stands and looks at them.
7292	Liquid splashes onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, bound tightly by twists of wire.
7293	Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face.
7294	SOMEONE closes on him from behind, throws his left arm around the man's neck, and clamps his wrists with his other hand.
7295	The man tears at the choking arm, and slams SOMEONE back into the bedroom wall.
7296	SOMEONE's back leaves a dent in the plaster wall.
7297	The man tries to throw him off, but SOMEONE squeezes his throat relentlessly.
7298	The man jabs him viciously in the ribs with his elbow, lifts him again, but can't escape the arm across his throat.
7299	He staggers across the room, lifting and twisting SOMEONE, still trying to throw him off.
7300	They reel across the room and he smashes SOMEONE into the wall again.
7301	He thrashes about, pulling desperately at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall before falling forward onto his knees.
7302	He rises off balance and SOMEONE drags him back down.
7303	He sinks to the floor and SOMEONE tightens his grip yanking against the man's neck.
7304	SOMEONE throws off the inert form and the maintenance man falls face down, motionless.
7305	SOMEONE crosses to the woman and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists.
7306	When they are free, her arms flop down.
7307	SOMEONE steps back and the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting.
7308	He stands over her, still in his cape, gazing down at her.
7309	SOMEONE gently opens a closet door.
7310	SOMEONE's sleeping body in a white night dress is carried from the shadowy light of her room to the foot of the stairs.
7311	She opens her eyes in the brighter light of the hall, and lifts her head as SOMEONE carries her up the staircase.
7312	She watches him, smiling very faintly, her long, fair hair falling back from her white forehead, and the light making a silver line of her profile, emphasizing her aquiline features, as she stares steadily up at him.
7313	He carries her along the landing and into the bedroom, where he lays her softly on the bed.
7314	Her eyes follow him around the room.
7315	Her head turns to him as he gets into bed beside her.
7316	She looks into his eyes for a moment as he lays his head on her shoulder, before she turns back, and gazes out beyond the foot of the bed.
7317	Her eyes close.
7318	SOMEONE opens her eyes again as SOMEONE closes his, and his face relaxes.
7319	SOMEONE, in a green T-shirt with white and gold bands around the middle, walks downstairs and into the kitchen.
7320	People are at the table, leaning towards each other, holding hands.
7321	They look around at him, smiling.
7322	SOMEONE picks up the paper and SOMEONE goes to the cooker.
7323	She is wearing a white T-shirt and green and white striped pajama bottoms.
7324	SOMEONE sits at the table, looking up at her cautiously.
7325	SOMEONE continues to read the paper.
7326	She turns from the cooker.
7327	SOMEONE continues to read, at last looking up and nodding.
7328	SOMEONE unscrews the cap of a big carton of orange juice and carefully pours himself half a glass full.
7329	He replaces the cap and stands to remove the carton from the table.
7330	He sits again, staring at the glass.
7331	The paper slides surreptitiously across the table to him.
7332	SOMEONE looks up at his father, who almost imperceptibly nods down at the story.
7333	SOMEONE pulls the paper to him and reads.
7334	Beside the headline is a black and white drawing of the heroic figure in a cape, with a particularly prominent square jaw.
7335	SOMEONE gazes down at the paper, his lips moving slightly.
7336	He looks up at SOMEONE, mouth open.
7337	SOMEONE nods expressionlessly.
7338	SOMEONE closes his mouth, swallows, and blinks hard.
7339	SOMEONE puts a finger to his lips, and SOMEONE nods and wipes away a tear.
7340	SOMEONE glances down, then looks up and gives SOMEONE a smile.
7341	At the Limited Edition Gallery, a bored security man looks at a picture, and a waitress carries a tray of food amongst the smartly dressed guests.
7342	SOMEONE is talking to a couple from his wheelchair.
7343	SOMEONE wanders in wearing a casual brown jacket and open-neck shirt, glances around him, and stops in front of a picture.
7344	A black woman with gray hair approaches him, looks across the busy gallery.
7345	SOMEONE looks across the busy gallery.
7346	SOMEONE's wheeling his chair from the gallery down the narrow corridor lined with comics.
7347	SOMEONE is following.
7348	SOMEONE freewheels down a ramp into his office and swings the chair around to face SOMEONE.
7349	He is wearing a tight black leather zip-up jacket with short glittering blue lapels.
7350	He reaches to a shelf behind him and picks up a paper.
7351	He looks at it and turns it round, showing SOMEONE the drawing of the hero in the cape.
7352	He drops the paper in his lap.
7353	Slowly, looking into SOMEONE's eyes, he holds out his gloved hand, and, equally slowly, SOMEONE takes it and squeezes.
7354	SOMEONE sees SOMEONE sitting in an airport lounge.
7355	Other passengers run to the big window.
7356	SOMEONE in his blue suit doesn't even turn his head.
7357	After some moments, he rises and limps away.
7358	SOMEONE's sitting on a bar stool.
7359	The man leans into him.
7360	On a railway platform, the train driver's approaching his cab, when SOMEONE steps down from it.
7361	SOMEONE walks down the platform.
7362	SOMEONE stumbles two or three paces back from SOMEONE, staring at the other man, eyes wide.
7363	SOMEONE coolly swivels his chair towards his workbench, and puts down the paper.
7364	SOMEONE looks over to the bench and sees a screen showing a video of Philadelphia Stadium.
7365	Another screen of technical drawings, newspaper clippings about disasters, books on chemistry and microbiology, batteries, wiring and timing devices, and, pinned to the wall, blueprints and more clippings.
7366	SOMEONE swings his chair back to face SOMEONE.
7367	Head slightly to one side, he looks SOMEONE full in the face.
7368	SOMEONE glances disbelievingly around SOMEONE's den.
7369	SOMEONE turns and walks away.
7370	SOMEONE's face is set, looking grim.
7371	SOMEONE smiles.
7372	The light beams from a torch held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing Grecian style robes.
7373	The logo fades away to black.
7374	A few flakes of snow gently flutter out of a night sky past a Christmas Tree made of fairy lights atop an establishment advertising itself as O'Hara's Pub.
7375	A few people wander down the street, clutching gifts for their loved ones.
7376	Inside the pub, various groups of friends, families, and work colleagues have gathered together for a festive drink and to exchange presents.
7377	They chat and laugh, enjoying the Christmas spirit.
7378	At the far end of the bar, a seedy, unshaven man in his late 40s, wearing SOMEONE costume, sits alone, enjoying two glasses of an entirely different kind of spirit.
7379	SOMEONE cuts a lonely figure as he sucks on a cigarette and calls over to the barman.
7380	SOMEONE stares sadly at a group of people drinking a toast.
7381	SOMEONE lurches unsteadily up a snow-filled back alley.
7382	He leans against the wall and throws up.
7383	In a brightly lit shopping mall, a mother and her young children ride up an escalator.
7384	At the top one of the children stares in wonder at the lavage SOMEONE's grotto that's been constructed.
7385	In the grotto dressed as an elf hands a photo of a girl and SOMEONE to her mother.
7386	SOMEONE, at work.
7387	The girl goes off and a boy of about eight walks up and sits on SOMEONE's knee.
7388	SOMEONE still looks seedy but has at least bothered to put his white beard on.
7389	He shoves the boy away.
7390	Little later, SOMEONE wets himself as his little helper wanders over.
7391	SOMEONE pulls down his beard and swigs from a bottle of grog, then examines his pants.
7392	His little helper shakes his head despairingly.
7393	The security guard says farewell to the last shoppers.
7394	As SOMEONE shuffles off, the guard keys a code into an alarm system.
7395	Up in the grotto, three snowmen sit behind statues of SOMEONE and the baby SOMEONE in his crib.
7396	The smallest snowman suddenly jumps up, but after a quick look to see the coast is clear, runs off, knocking people over in the process.
7397	The snowman slides down between the escalators as the alarm system continues its arming countdown.
7398	He crashes into a display at the bottom and trots up to run through the shop.
7399	The snowman pulls the arm off of a mannequin as he goes.
7400	He uses the arm to reach up and switch off the alarm before it can ON.
7401	The snowman pulls his head off, revealing SOMEONE's profusely sweating little helper.
7402	Now in regular clothes, SOMEONE's little helper opens a back door and finds SOMEONE surrounded by empty beer cans.
7403	The elf shakes his head sadly.
7404	SOMEONE mooches inside past his less than impressed elf.
7405	In the store's vault, SOMEONE uses a heavy drill to bore through the door of a locked safe.
7406	Out on the shop floor of the store, the elf walks along towing a small hand cart, SOMEONE pulls out the drill from the safe door.
7407	On the shop floor, his little helper helps himself to an expensive handbag from a display cabinet, then some women's designer shoes, all of which are detailed on a list.
7408	He checks his list while eyeing a string of pearls in a cabinet, and uses a bead rack to smash it open.
7409	Later he joins SOMEONE in the vault, and finds SOMEONE peering through the hole he drilled.
7410	SOMEONE uses a chisel.
7411	He opens the safe and wards of notes spil out onto the floor.
7412	An oriental woman sits at the wheel of a van as SOMEONE and his little helper climb in the back with their booty.
7413	She turns to the elf.
7414	The woman puts her foot on the accelerator, and the van speeds off throwing SOMEONE and the elf backwards.
7415	Later SOMEONE, who in less seasonal times goes by the name of SOMEONE, dances with SOMEONE, the elf in a bar.
7416	SOMEONE puts down SOMEONE on a bar stool by the counter.
7417	and sits down beside him.
7418	He calls over to the barmaid.
7419	The barmaid serves them.
7420	People raise their glasses.
7421	They down their drinks and set the glasses back down on the counter.
7422	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a dubious look.
7423	SOMEONE looks expectantly at SOMEONE, who considers, and then turns to the barmaid.
7424	He turns back to SOMEONE with a half smile.
7425	He looks down doubtfully at his empty glass.
7426	 A plethora of beautiful bikini-clad women adorn the sand.
7427	SOMEONE, now in a Hawaiian shirt, stands behind the counter of a beachfront bar, chopping up some lemons and limes.
7428	He puts them under the counter and pours a generous measure of vodka into a tumbler.
7429	As he does so, an irate man clutching a tray of glasses joins him behind the counter.
7430	SOMEONE slurps at the drink.
7431	The barman punches him in the guts and tosses him over the counter.
7432	SOMEONE throws a vodka bottle at the barman.
7433	And misses it.
7434	The barman leaps over the counter, and SOMEONE runs for it.
7435	SOMEONE does as suggested.
7436	Sometime later he is sitting alone having a good leech at some more bikini clad lovelies playing volleyball.
7437	He licks his lips as he admires their well-toned backsides and sips from a bottle of beer.
7438	The next morning, SOMEONE is asleep on his bed in a not-so- awful, not-so-great apartment.
7439	He reaches over to the clock radio which is surrounded by last night's empties and fumbles for the off button, unable to find it he rips it out of its socket.
7440	Having smashed the clock and several empties, he sits down on the bed, and, in need of refreshment, drinks from a half-full bottle with a cigarette end floating about it in.
7441	A smart convertible pulls up at a car valeting serviced by the beach.
7442	SOMEONE strolls up as the driver hands over the keys.
7443	The young guy from the valet service drives off with the convertible and SOMEONE walks over to a board holding the car keys.
7444	He looks around then picks up several of the keys.
7445	He saunters through the parking lot pressing the remotes and cars flash and unlock.
7446	SOMEONE tosses the keys away nonchalantly and keeps unlocking.
7447	He walks up to one of the cars he is just unlocked, then presses another remote and turns to see a blue sports convertible.
7448	His eyes brighten and he goes for that.
7449	He climbs in and, opening the glove compartment, he takes out the tax disk and reads the address on it.
7450	He replaces the disk, starts engine, and drives away.
7451	The car is parked outside a grand mansion with a pillared entranceway.
7452	Inside, SOMEONE climbs an elegant marble staircase toward a balustrated balcony.
7453	Upstairs, in a smart kitchen, he drinks milk from the bottle, then replaces it in the well-stocked fridge.
7454	He munches on a chicken leg and sits on the toilet.
7455	Later he fiddles with the handle of the un-flushing toilet.
7456	He stands up and looks at it.
7457	He tosses the chicken leg down the pan as he saunters aimlessly down the hallway, he tips oil paintings off the wall.
7458	On a wood panelled wall he sees a large portrait of a boy with dark hair.
7459	He peeks behind the painting, then removes it from the wall revealing a safe.
7460	He sticks his ear to the safe and starts to turn the combination lock.
7461	His eyes catch site of a companion set by the fireplace.
7462	From it, he selects the poker and attacks the safe.
7463	He finds lots of money.
7464	At an exotic club, he ignores the girl writhing in front of him and rubs a scratch card.
7465	He looks up as she crawls away.
7466	The girl moves towards a second exotic dancer on stage in front of another punter.
7467	SOMEONE scratches away.
7468	A scantily-clad waitress brings beer to him.
7469	He places a scratch card and in the bikini bottoms.
7470	Later, she follows him into his apartment.
7471	She wanders away as SOMEONE winds back through his phone messages.
7472	People are once again in their festive elf and SOMEONE costumes, as they strode through a heat shimmer in a car park.
7473	SOMEONE has pulled his beer down as a fag dangles from the corner of his mouth.
7474	He clutches a bottle of dog in his left hand as he strolls along and removes the cigarette from his mouth and takes a good pull on his bottle draining it of its contents.
7475	He then lobs the bottle over his shoulder and it smashes on a Mercedes windscreen.
7476	Unconcerned, SOMEONE ambles after SOMEONE towards a mall inside a Manager deals with an irritate SOMEONE.
7477	SOMEONE sees people.
7478	He gazes lustly after her through his cigarette smoke.
7479	SOMEONE winces.
7480	SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE.
7481	In an office, SOMEONE sits with a black guy who takes a gargantuan drag on a cigarette.
7482	The security chief eyes SOMEONE.
7483	The chief peels an orange.
7484	Down in front of the grotto, SOMEONE works a crowd of kids.
7485	SOMEONE's chair is conspicuously empty.
7486	SOMEONE turns to a gum-chewing female helper.
7487	SOMEONE rolls his eyes, shakes his head, then turns to the kids.
7488	SOMEONE goes backstage and finds SOMEONE comatose.
7489	He wakes him roughly.
7490	SOMEONE swigs his grog as SOMEONE goes out front where kids are lined up.
7491	Inside the grotto.
7492	A fat kid with an ice cream.
7493	The fat kid takes a deep breath and sneezes over SOMEONE.
7494	A small girl sits on snotty SOMEONE's knee.
7495	A boy with long hair sits on his knee.
7496	He shoos the boy away and looks over at SOMEONE.
7497	A bus pulls up at a bus stop near some cool skaterat kids.
7498	The bus door open and a fat boy with curly blonde hair steps off.
7499	The skaterats clock him.
7500	SOMEONE tries to look dignified.
7501	He walks on.
7502	The skaterat throws a tin which bounces off SOMEONE's hand.
7503	Eyes front, SOMEONE waddles on towards the mall.
7504	Inside, he is in the grotto.
7505	SOMEONE impatiently munches nuts.
7506	SOMEONE leads SOMEONE over to surly SOMEONE and he sits on his knee.
7507	SOMEONE stares at him.
7508	He is got boogies dangling from his paunchy nose.
7509	He pulls his beard.
7510	At the end of the day, SOMEONE is sitting in the car park outside the mall as people come out.
7511	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE the finger as he walks away across the car park.
7512	SOMEONE watches him go.
7513	Still in his SOMEONE suit, SOMEONE sits alone at the counter in a bar and lights a cigarette.
7514	He chews some gum and looks resentfully around the bar.
7515	He takes in the usual collection of festive social drinkers out enjoying a Christmas drink.
7516	He drags on his cigarette and his gaze falls on a bald, goatee-bearded Indian guy giving him the evil eye across the bar.
7517	SOMEONE stares back at him.
7518	The Indian guy keeps his malevolent gaze on SOMEONE and looks away.
7519	The barmaid comes over to join them and sniffs his empty glass.
7520	The barmaid refills his glass and gives him a sunny smile.
7521	He knocks back his drink.
7522	She frowns, then smiles.
7523	The barmaid grins and laughs.
7524	She pours out a shot for herself as well as SOMEONE's.
7525	They knock their drinks back, and SOMEONE puffs on his cigarette.
7526	She nods and looks at his glass.
7527	She pours him another shot, and then one for herself.
7528	They down them in one.
7529	She gives him a coy look.
7530	And he does, in his beaten up old car.
7531	After the festive fornication, SOMEONE leans against the car having a smoke.
7532	She gets out of the car and faces him.
7533	He half smiles and nods.
7534	She gives him a smile and heads off.
7535	Once she is gone, the moody looking Indian guy from the bar runs over and shoves SOMEONE.
7536	Curly head SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE off SOMEONE.
7537	SOMEONE marches off into the night.
7538	SOMEONE catches his breath and turns to SOMEONE.
7539	SOMEONE turns to him.
7540	Sometime later SOMEONE gives fat ass a lift and left home in his knacker old car.
7541	Sitting in the passenger seat, the kid stares at him and smiles warmly.SOMEONE looks away from it.
7542	Apparently unmoved, the kid keeps staring at SOMEONE.
7543	SOMEONE turns off his engine and one working headlight, then gets out of the car with the kid.
7544	SOMEONE admires the affluent suburban house they are in front of.
7545	SOMEONE frowns.
7546	As the kid unlocks the door, SOMEONE pulls out a cotch and puts on a black balaclava.
7547	Inside, SOMEONE is watching a TV program featuring dancing fruit.
7548	SOMEONE walks past SOMEONE, apparently unmoved by the fact that SOMEONE is wearing a black balaclava.
7549	SOMEONE turns to the kid.
7550	The kid nods.
7551	SOMEONE pulls up his balaclava.
7552	He sure does.
7553	SOMEONE opens it and removes wads of cash and a passport.
7554	SOMEONE shuts the safe and goes and sits down in an armchair.
7555	The credulous kid beams at him.
7556	The very nice BMW which SOMEONE drives away in.
7557	The next day at the mall, SOMEONE, the manager, is doing his rounds.
7558	He strolls through a woman's wear shop for larger ladies.
7559	Some noise is emanating from the changing room catches attention.
7560	SOMEONE decides to go and investigate.
7561	SOMEONE looks under a cubicle door and sees a woman's feet and, behind them, a man's with red SOMEONE pants at his ankles.
7562	In SOMEONE's office.
7563	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a reproachful look and takes a candy from a jar on his desk as he goes.
7564	Later, SOMEONE wanders through a restaurant in the mall sipping a coke.
7565	He spots SOMEONE putting the moves on a hot-bodied blonde at a pinball machine.
7566	SOMEONE thrusts his crotch into the blonde.
7567	The BMW.
7568	As he opens the car door, a pile of empties spill out.
7569	 He drives off crashing them on his wheels.
7570	SOMEONE is with SOMEONE, the security chief.
7571	SOMEONE eats an orange.
7572	SOMEONE winces at the phrase.
7573	SOMEONE munches on his orange and regards bespectacled SOMEONE, who looks away thoughtfully.
7574	That night, SOMEONE drives a seven series BMW in through the gates of the motel.
7575	He sees SOMEONE with a torch is in his room.
7576	He kills the lights of the car.
7577	She takes the strawberry blonde wig off and comes over.
7578	On the phone.
7579	SOMEONE puts his stuff down on a bed and begins taking off his fake snow-covered boots.
7580	He gets off the bed and goes over to a wardrobe.
7581	The kid watches SOMEONE in the bath.
7582	The kid blinks a couple of times.
7583	SOMEONE lies in bed, the kid hovering at the bedside.
7584	The next morning, SOMEONE is still asleep in bed.
7585	The kid comes in, clutching a glass of orange juice and an advent calendar.
7586	Gradually, SOMEONE surfaces from his slumber.
7587	He sits up and takes the glass.
7588	He gives the kid a look and puts the glass down.
7589	The kid climbs on to the bed.
7590	He settles beside SOMEONE and opens the relevant door on the calendar, then reads what's written on the back of the door.
7591	The kid gives a doubtful looking SOMEONE the door.
7592	He knocks the chocolate out of the calendar.
7593	He does and turns to SOMEONE.
7594	The kid gets off the bed.
7595	SOMEONE looks dubiously at the door off the calendar.
7596	At lunchtime, he is eating with SOMEONE and his oriental girlfriend, SOMEONE, at a restaurant in the mall.
7597	SOMEONE regards him with thinly-veiled contempt.
7598	SOMEONE masticates a massive mouthful of salad and glares vainfully at SOMEONE.
7599	People head off.
7600	A mom and her young son spot SOMEONE in his SOMEONE suit.
7601	SOMEONE's mother looks at SOMEONE expectantly as she holds the hand of the sulky boy by her side.
7602	SOMEONE's mum scoops him up and hurries away, leaving dear old SOMEONE to his salad.
7603	Out in the shops, SOMEONE scrutinizes a swatch of fabric and tries on a pair of designer sunglasses.
7604	She moves on and looks over a mink stole with a very critical eye.
7605	Having decided it's not too bad, she notes it down on her shopping list.
7606	Detecting a possible sale, a saleswoman comes over to her.
7607	Again, SOMEONE, the security chief, walks up behind a boy pursuing a shelf of video games.
7608	SOMEONE turns back to the boy.
7609	Back at his new digs, SOMEONE is playing checkers with the kid.
7610	The kid moves a piece, keeping his finger on it.
7611	Uncertain, he moves it back again.
7612	SOMEONE eyes the kid a little impatiently.
7613	The kid moves another counter, but still keeps a pudgy finger on it, and looks at SOMEONE, then changes his mind and moves it back.
7614	SOMEONE watches as the kid moves a third piece but still keeps his finger on the counter.
7615	The kid removes his finger.
7616	Then, before SOMEONE can move, changes his mind and puts the counter back where it was.
7617	SOMEONE struggles to contain his irritation.
7618	The kid quickly moves one of his pieces, taking three of SOMEONE's, and reaching the far end of the board at the same time.
7619	SOMEONE glares and throws the board in the air.
7620	The kid stares placidly at him.
7621	The kid is unruffled.
7622	SOMEONE opens the door to a balding man.
7623	He proffers his hand.
7624	SOMEONE glances at the kid.
7625	He hands SOMEONE some paperwork.
7626	As SOMEONE nods off in front of the TV, SOMEONE is outside entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub.
7627	Still wearing his festive red cap, SOMEONE energetically humps SOMEONE, the barmaid up against the side of the hot tub putting in smokes and foam.
7628	Afterwards, in the living room, he pours himself a straight vodka and her one with orange.
7629	They sit on the sofa together.
7630	He hands her her glass, and they each take a swig of their respective drinks.
7631	She sits back and smiles.
7632	She laughs to herself, and he nods off.
7633	She looks a little bit disappointed.
7634	Later SOMEONE accompanies her to the front door and sees her out.
7635	She gives him a kiss and trips over the front step.
7636	She heads off into the night.
7637	SOMEONE shuts the front door and, vodka bottle in hand, reaches over to the hall table where the kids advent calendar is lying.
7638	He picks up the calendar and puts the bottle down on the table.
7639	He then proceeds to tear open the remaining doors on the calendar and scarf the chocolate inside.
7640	Calendar ruined, chocolate eaten, he picks up the vodka bottle and lurches towards the lounge.
7641	He stops in the doorway and drains the bottle of its remaining contents, which is about a quarter.
7642	He belches, falls backwards, and lies unconscious on the hall carpet.
7643	The next morning he is roused by a distressed kid and is unfazed as his grandma.
7644	The kid's hand is covered in blood.
7645	SOMEONE follows him to the kitchen where he puts the hand under the tap.
7646	He pours vodka on the cut.
7647	SOMEONE turns the tap off, takes a slug of vodka, and walks back into the hall.
7648	SOMEONE looks slightly uneasy.
7649	Then he spots the tattered remains of the advent calendar lying on the hall table.
7650	Later that morning, SOMEONE drives the BMW into the deserted car park.
7651	SOMEONE is standing beside a green van waiting for him.
7652	They open the back of the van, and SOMEONE irritably hands SOMEONE an empty SOMEONE sack.
7653	SOMEONE shakes his head.
7654	He puts a drill in the gift-wrapped box.
7655	The gift-wrapped safe-breaking equipment loaded into the sack, people head for the mall.
7656	Outside a door, a security guard is on duty.
7657	The tall, blonde security guard checks his watch.
7658	In the back room SOMEONE puts the sack down, and SOMEONE points to an air conditioning vent.
7659	SOMEONE takes the cover off the vent and clamors into the duct.
7660	Clutching a torch, he crawls along it.
7661	A man in an office looks up at the duct as noises emanate from it.
7662	Another woman working at her desk looks up, as does a woman at the next desk.
7663	The woman turns around, looks at the duct, shrugs, and gets on with her work.
7664	SOMEONE arrives at a vent and looks out into a security office full of monitors.
7665	He looks at the equipment and makes some notes on a pad.
7666	SOMEONE is having a pedicure.
7667	He answers his phone.
7668	SOMEONE, the kid's dad, is in prison.
7669	SOMEONE walks into the prison visitors room where balding, bespectacled SOMEONE is sitting.
7670	SOMEONE nods his head and gets up.
7671	SOMEONE looks confused.
7672	SOMEONE cooks for the kid and SOMEONE.
7673	He serves it up.
7674	He spoons a dollop onto it.
7675	He turns back to the stove and flips the bologna.
7676	The kid heads off to get it.
7677	SOMEONE serves up a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself and puts it on the breakfast bar.
7678	The kid hands it to him.
7679	He hands it back to the kid who struggles to open the appropriate door.
7680	Rather as if SOMEONE might have already opened it and then stuck it back down with a bit too much adhesive.
7681	SOMEONE watches out of the corner of his eye as the kid finds a cheap sweet inside.
7682	SOMEONE is with SOMEONE, who's mixing himself a dose of Fibracell stool softener.
7683	SOMEONE winces.
7684	SOMEONE slurps his stool softener and grimaces.
7685	The bus pulls up outside the mall and the skaterats see the kid getting off at the stop.
7686	The kid sees them and hesitates for a moment.
7687	Then, eyes front, keeps walking down the street.
7688	The skate rats follow in, close behind him, their interest clearly malicious.
7689	They get him and they grot him.
7690	The boy wanders off and SOMEONE scratches his own ass.
7691	The kid appears, his pants around his armpits.
7692	SOMEONE heads off.
7693	SOMEONE looks at the kid.
7694	SOMEONE stares incredulously at the kid for a moment then shakes his head.
7695	The kid just stares at him.
7696	The kid walks away still with his underpants up around his armpits.
7697	SOMEONE watches him go with a doleful expression.
7698	SOMEONE turns back to SOMEONE who, for an elf, is staring at him in a very deadpan way.
7699	SOMEONE is the next in line.
7700	People in a bar.
7701	SOMEONE shifts uneasily.
7702	SOMEONE leans forward.
7703	SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE and rubs his chin thoughtfully.
7704	SOMEONE gets up from the table and goes.
7705	People regard each other.
7706	SOMEONE resignedly rests his head on his hand while SOMEONE slips into a brooding silence.
7707	The next day, a very large queue of excited children and their mothers has formed at the western-themed Christmas Corral Grotto.
7708	A semi-comatose SOMEONE is on his way as he lies on the escalator clutching a broken bottle.
7709	SOMEONE, back in elf guise, is trying to calm the kids.
7710	At the top of the escalator, SOMEONE drunkenly gets to his feet and lurches slowly towards the grotto, broken bottle still in hand.
7711	SOMEONE shakes his head as SOMEONE makes his way into the grotto, bumping into one of the kids as he does so.
7712	In his state of extreme over-refreshment, he keels over and collapses on top of a fake cactus and a sack of presents.
7713	The kids and moms gasp as SOMEONE rallies and gets on his feet, only to fall over a life-size model donkey.
7714	He is falling on his back.
7715	He sees a second donkey going over.
7716	He scrambles to his feet and slugs the donkey with a big right hook, knocking its head off.
7717	He then punches and kicks the donkey's body to bits in a fine display of drunken violence.
7718	The moms hurriedly usher their offspring away as SOMEONE strides up.
7719	SOMEONE drops SOMEONE.
7720	SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE contemptuously in the leg and marches off.
7721	and drags SOMEONE away.
7722	Later on, SOMEONE is back at the kid's house in the garage.
7723	He sits in SOMEONE's BMW with the engine running, having first run a hose from the exhaust pipe into the driver's window in order to commit a seasonal suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.
7724	The kid walks into the garage and sees him.
7725	SOMEONE's head lolls to one side as he inhales the noxious fumes.
7726	The kid walks over to the car and looks in through the driver's window.
7727	SOMEONE moves slightly.
7728	SOMEONE raises his head a little and looks at the kid.
7729	The kid turns and makes to go out of the garage.
7730	SOMEONE winds the driver's window down and hands the kid a letter.
7731	He sees the kid has got a black eye.
7732	Later, SOMEONE is smashing into the chief skaterat's face.
7733	He turns to the rest of the gang.
7734	Two other kids, on bikes, watch astounded as SOMEONE administers the festive beating.
7735	Back at the mall, people are in the locker rooms after a hard day dishing out presents.
7736	SOMEONE gets changed out of his elf gear while SOMEONE, in contemplative mood, sits on a bench and sucks on a bottle of gut rot.
7737	SOMEONE looks incredulously at SOMEONE who drags on a fag.
7738	In a boxing occa.
7739	He is talking to the kid.
7740	SOMEONE is his opponent.
7741	SOMEONE looks him over.
7742	The kid steps forward and kicks SOMEONE in the crotch, doubling him up.
7743	He punches the kid low.
7744	He whacks SOMEONE in the balls too.
7745	He hits SOMEONE in the nuts and all three combatants lie, writhing in agony, on the canvas.
7746	SOMEONE turns to the kid.
7747	They kick at each other.
7748	That night, SOMEONE has collapsed in front of the TV in the lounge when people come in, they see her.
7749	SOMEONE lies back on the sofa, deathly still, with her mouth agape.
7750	They walk a little closer.
7751	SOMEONE goes over to her.
7752	SOMEONE looks on anxiously as SOMEONE bends over SOMEONE.
7753	SOMEONE looks round at SOMEONE.
7754	He holds his hand in front of her mouth then puts his head to her chest to listen for a heartbeat.
7755	SOMEONE suddenly comes to.
7756	Later on, in a bedroom, a black rug is spread out on the floor.
7757	On it lies odd discarded clothes.
7758	Nearby, SOMEONE lies on her back in her bra and jeans.
7759	A bare-chested SOMEONE sits astride her, wearing his jeans and SOMEONE hat.
7760	He leans down and seductively licks from her navel up to her bra.
7761	He then leans forward and kisses her.
7762	He kisses his way back down her body and grips her pants between his teeth and pulls on them.
7763	As he does so, the kid comes in through the door.
7764	He hands SOMEONE a roughly carved bit of wood with a ribbon round it.
7765	Mystified, SOMEONE looks at it.

7789	As he gets closer, he sees it's SOMEONE waving a torch.
7790	SOMEONE stops in front of SOMEONE, who moves his Stetson and gets out of the car with a wary expression.
7791	He shakes his head wierdly.
7792	SOMEONE gives him a helpless look.
7793	SOMEONE heads back to his car and SOMEONE smiles.
7794	SOMEONE lifts the bonnet of his Chevy.

7796	SOMEONE steps forward with the jump leads but can't reach the battery.
7797	SOMEONE backs away from between the car and the van as SOMEONE starts the van up.
7798	SOMEONE leans back against the grill of the Chevy and lights himself a smoke.
7799	SOMEONE nods to SOMEONE and she drops the van into gear, hits the gas, and crushes SOMEONE between the two vechicles.
7800	SOMEONE reverses and SOMEONE slithers down the grill of the Chevy onto the ground.
7801	 SOMEONE walks up to him.
7802	SOMEONE sighs and walks to the van.
7803	He removes the jump start cables from the van, returns to SOMEONE and clips them onto his ears.
7804	Back at SOMEONE's, SOMEONE opens the front door to SOMEONE, who's got a bag of groceries.
7805	He eyes her figure appreciatively.
7806	In the kitchen, people make necklaces out of pieces of popcorn.
7807	She adds it to a big bowl.
7808	In the hall, SOMEONE stands on a chair to put decorations on the tree.
7809	SOMEONE stares, mesmerized by her backside, and begins fondling it.

7811	She quickly does it back up and gives SOMEONE a kiss.
7812	In the lounge, SOMEONE has conked out on the sofa.
7813	SOMEONE carefully removes her slippers and then peels off her sheer, hold-up socks.

7820	SOMEONE looks down sadly, and SOMEONE relents.
7821	Bemused SOMEONE shakes his hand.

7823	Once SOMEONE is gone, SOMEONE turns around and goes back to lighting the candle bags.
7824	In the mall, all the security guard bids the last shoppers farewell.
7825	SOMEONE is amongst the shoppers.
7826	She makes a show of looking at a price tag on a table laden with sweaters, and, at the same time, pushes the table into a new position.
7827	She makes a minor adjust to its position and heads off.
7828	People are in the back room.
7829	A ladder leads up to the air vent.
7830	SOMEONE snaps a popper.
7831	SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE.
7832	While the guard bids farewell to shoppers, SOMEONE crawls through the vent.
7833	Once SOMEONE and the last of the shoppers have gone, the security guard checks his watch and taps a code into the alarm system.
7834	SOMEONE is in the air conditioning duct overlooking the security booth.
7835	He presses a button on a remote control and switches off all the security cameras.
7836	He then hurries back along the duct.
7837	 He plunges down the duct heading straight down and smashes through a vent, which is above the table of sweaters SOMEONE had repositioned to break his fall.
7838	The table collapses, and he leaps to his feet.
7839	He runs to the alarm console and turns it off with two seconds to spare.

7849	Next up, he dons dark goggles and tries to cut his way in with an arc welder.
7850	At home, SOMEONE takes a sauce bottle from the fridge and hands it to SOMEONE.
7851	The welding doesn't go well.
7852	SOMEONE takes a red camisole off a shop dummy and then kisses its left breast.
7853	Next, he comes to the dummy modeling the mink stole.
7854	Unfortunately the dummy is too tall for him to reach it.
7855	After jumping up and down a bit, he catches his breath and spots another mannequin holding a golf club.
7856	He takes the club and tries to remove the stole from around the dummy's neck with it, but it won't budge.
7857	Eventually he gives up, and using the club like an ax, starts to chop the dummy's legs off.
7858	Down in the office, SOMEONE has resorted to brute force and uses a sledge hammer on the safe door.
7859	SOMEONE doesnt crack the safe but SOMEONE suceeds in felling the dummy.
7860	He takes the stole from around its neck.

7895	He takes several bullets.
7896	Still clutching the elephant, SOMEONE crawls towards SOMEONE's front door.
7897	The gun-toting cops close in on him.
7898	SOMEONE reaches the front step, but he is too badly injured to go any further.
7899	He collapses and lies motionless.
7900	The posse of cops surround him, keeping him covered as the screen fades slowly.

7949	SOMEONE looks unconvinced.
7950	SOMEONE takes a pull on a bottle of beer.

7996	As he turns to run, a massive explosion erupts from the debris, throwing him to the ground.
7997	He looks up, then gets to his feet.
7998	He looks at a carriage lying on its side.
7999	It's racked by a series of explosions.
8000	SOMEONE clasps the locket tightly in his left hand.
8001	He watches as an explosion throws a chunk of the carriage high into the air.
8002	It crashes into the Earth a little distance away.

8023	There's a guy at the wheel of the pickup.
8024	SOMEONE approaches the un-moving black guy.
8025	The boys watch as SOMEONE draws closer to him.
8026	She touches his arm and it hangs limply.

8045	SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the white cube he took from the crash site.
8046	Their faces grimed from the explosions, people regard each other for a moment.
8047	Then SOMEONE gets into the Coupe's driving seat and heads off.
8048	SOMEONE and the others watch her go.
8049	At home, SOMEONE sits in the bath, clutching the white cube, which has a knobbly surface.
8050	He stares thoughtfully into the distance.
8051	Seen from a hillside, the lights of SOMEONE twinkle in the darkness.
8052	The next morning, SOMEONE is asleep in bed.

8071	The film makers look down at the destruction.
8072	SOMEONE looks down with a troubled expression.
8073	At the crash site, Air Force personnel are busy clearing up the cargo of strange white cubes.
8074	They repack them in crates, which are, in turn, loaded onto military lorries.
8075	SOMEONE's dad SOMEONE is there with SOMEONE.
8076	The colonel goes.
8077	Unsatisfied, SOMEONE looks around and sees men carefully making a plaster of Paris mold.
8078	Back at the police station, he talks to SOMEONE.
8079	The sheriff goes, leaving SOMEONE looking nonplussed.
8080	The sheriff drives his car into a gas station and pulls up by the pumps.
8081	He goes into the shop and finds the clerk playing with a new Sony Walkman.
8082	SOMEONE can't hear him, the sheriff lobs a candy bar.
8083	The sheriff pays for his petrol and the candy bar, then goes back outside.
8084	He fills his patrol car and opens the candy bar.
8085	His attention is caught by some odd noises and he looks around.
8086	A pack of dogs runs across the filling station forecourt.
8087	Surprised, the sheriff looks around.
8088	His patrol car starts malfunctioning.
8089	He goes to check it out.
8090	Hearing something move nearby, the sheriff goes to investigate.
8091	He keeps a hand on his gun.
8092	He nearly leaps out of his skin as a dumpster flies past him.
8093	In the shop, SOMEONE is oblivious as his Walkman drowns out all the sound.
8094	Over his shoulder, the sheriff's car jolts violently.
8095	Suddenly, the lights flicker and SOMEONE looks round.
8096	He pulls his headphones off as he looks out of the window.
8097	The lights continue flickering.
8098	Looking apprehensive, SOMEONE slowly makes his way outside.
8099	The front of the sheriff's car has been smashed in by a violent impact.
8100	SOMEONE walks around the wrecked patrol car.
8101	Steam rises from its ruptured radiator.
8102	SOMEONE picks the petrol pump's nozzle out of a large pool of gasoline on the ground.
8103	Hearing something behind him, he turns around and looks completely terrified.
8104	He stumbles and runs back into the shop.
8105	Something comes after him.
8106	It smashes the windows, knocking him to the floor, then grabs him, dragging him back.
8107	Next day, SOMEONE is making SOMEONE up as one of the un-dead.
8108	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a questioning look.
8109	She nods pensively.
8110	The lights in the room flickered.
8111	SOMEONE adopts a dead-eyed zombie persona and lurches slowly towards SOMEONE.
8112	Waving her arms around jerkily, she draws closer.
8113	She lunges at him, pretending to bite his neck.

8115	SOMEONE goes.
8116	SOMEONE had been watching them.
8117	SOMEONE is at the wrecked gas station.

8120	On a used car lot, the engines have been stolen from all the cars.
8121	SOMEONE watches suspiciously as a convoy of military lorries passes by on the road.
8122	In the back of one, he notes some airmen operating some kind of radio listening device.
8123	As dusk approaches, SOMEONE cycles beside a pylon in a field as he looks for his dog.
8124	He gets off his bike and looks around.
8125	Back in town, SOMEONE cycles up beside a community bulletin board and sticks a flyer on it.
8126	As he looks at the board, something strikes him.

8134	SOMEONE is working on a power line outside a junkyard.
8135	He works from the cherry picker on the back of his truck.
8136	A noise emanates from the junkyard and he looks over at it for a moment, then gets back on with his job.
8137	Bits of scrap fly up into the air from the junkyard.
8138	SOMEONE watches with mounting concern as a huge hunk of junk sails overhead and lands in the road.
8139	It's a cooker.
8140	SOMEONE operates the controls for his cherry picker and gets it to raise him higher so that he can get a better view of the junkyard.
8141	The activity in the yard appears to have stopped.
8142	As he peers into the gloom, SOMEONE notices the headlights of his truck and the streetlight nearby start to flicker.
8143	The cherry picker has stopped working.
8144	Something suddenly lunges out of the trees and grabs him, jolting his truck and breaking the windscreen.
8145	SOMEONE is addressing a meeting of concerned locals.
8146	SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE as one of the other deputies leads him away.

8152	He smiles.
8153	SOMEONE comes in.

8161	The Colonel's expression hardens.
8162	SOMEONE steps back over to the colonel.
8163	Sitting in the patrol car, SOMEONE watches as the two men shake hands.
8164	Later, people return home.
8165	With tears in his eyes, SOMEONE glares at his father.
8166	SOMEONE glares back at him, struggling to contain his emotions.
8167	SOMEONE turns away and marches out of the house, leaving SOMEONE looking bleak.
8168	A tear rolls down his cheek and he wipes it away with his hand.
8169	At dusk, SOMEONE cycles up a steep hill and goes in through the gates of a cemetery at the top.
8170	He cycles on between the headstones.
8171	SOMEONE sits silently staring into the distance.
8172	He looks down at his mother's locket which he holds in his hand.
8173	Hearing a noise, he looks up.
8174	He gets to his feet and takes a torch from his rock sack.
8175	He shines it on a building nearby.
8176	Looking through a window, he can see earth being tossed about inside the building.
8177	Spooked, he runs off.
8178	SOMEONE drives his patrol car through the gates of Lilian Air Field.
8179	Inside the compound, his car is immediately surrounded by heavily armed soldiers.
8180	SOMEONE sits at SOMEONE's bedside.
8181	His face lacerated from the train crash, SOMEONE glares stonily back at the Colonel from his hospital bed.
8182	SOMEONE leans in closer to him.
8183	The Colonel gives him a hard stare and walks away from the bedside.
8184	His aide, SOMEONE, injects toxin into SOMEONE's drip, and he begins to convulse.
8185	SOMEONE watches this passionately as SOMEONE dies.
8186	The Colonel stand with his back to the bed and waits for it to go quiet.
8187	Back at home, SOMEONE is awakened in the middle of the night by a knocking at his window.
8188	He gets up.
8189	He opens the window to SOMEONE.
8190	She climbs in through the window.
8191	He takes her hand to help her down off the desk.
8192	He tries the light.
8193	A Cinay projector starts up.
8194	SOMEONE moves forward to watch the film.
8195	The footage is of SOMEONE as a baby with his mother.
8196	He sucks on her locket as she holds him.
8197	Footage of his first birthday.
8198	His mother blows out a solitary candle on his cake.
8199	She picks him up in her arms.
8200	Now SOMEONE is about three years old.
8201	His mother measures his height against the wall.
8202	She kisses a cut on his hand better.
8203	SOMEONE watches as the footage changes to him with his mother at Christmas.
8204	On screen, she smiles as SOMEONE holds up a present.
8205	He watches somberly as on screen, his mother picks him up and plays with him in the garden.
8206	She laughs into the camera.
8207	Un-shed tears form in SOMEONE's eyes as she watches.
8208	Captured together on the home movie, SOMEONE and his mother play together on some distant summer's day.
8209	SOMEONE waves at the camera.
8210	SOMEONE looks over at SOMEONE.
8211	She is sitting with her back to him.
8212	Her shoulders heave and tears roll down her face.
8213	She struggles to find the words.
8214	SOMEONE stares at her.
8215	SOMEONE watches the last bit of footage which is of SOMEONE's mother pushing him on a swing.
8216	The film runs out and spins around on the reel.
8217	People see the rattling noises coming from the strange cube SOMEONE took from the crash site.
8218	It vibrates across the tabletop.
8219	SOMEONE wipes the tears from her eyes.
8220	SOMEONE picks up a pencil and gently prods the cube.
8221	It continues vibrating.
8222	He and SOMEONE exchange a look.
8223	The cube shoots of the table and smashes through the wall leaving a hole in the wall and a poster of the space shuttle that pinned to it.
8224	People go over to the hole and peer through it.
8225	The lights of the tomb and the water tower can be seen in the distance through it.
8226	They exchange a look.
8227	Later, SOMEONE carefully slips her key into her front door and opens it.
8228	She steps into the hall and puts the key in a dish on a side board.
8229	She sees SOMEONE sitting in the front room.
8230	She goes in to him, and finds him smoking and drinking.
8231	Wounded, she runs outside, grabs her bicycle and rides off.
8232	SOMEONE comes running out after her.
8233	Fighting back tears, SOMEONE cycles grimly on, SOMEONE comes after her in the yellow Coupe.
8234	She glances nervously over her shoulder as the V8 barrels after her.
8235	She rounds a corner and the coupe clips the curb as it takes the corner.
8236	SOMEONE jams her brakes on and pulls a u-turn in the road.
8237	She cycles back past SOMEONE.
8238	Taking his eye off the road, he careens in to the back of a parked car.
8239	Hearing the impact, SOMEONE stops and looks back.
8240	As she stares at the wreck, she doesn't notice a massive creature moving behind her.
8241	His face bloodied, SOMEONE sits up in the driver's seat.
8242	SOMEONE turns around and sees the creature.
8243	SOMEONE looks in his rear view mirror.
8244	He tries to get out of the car.
8245	He tumbles out of the passenger door.
8246	He runs back up the street and trips over SOMEONE's bike.
8247	Soldiers watch a colleague using a flamethrower.
8248	People pick up their processed film.
8249	As they cycle off past the town's water tower, a vast plume of smoke rises just outside the town.
8250	Stuck in an indentation on the side of the water tower tank, is the vibrating cube.
8251	Their footage from the night of the crash.
8252	The footage of the crash is just clouds of smoke.
8253	SOMEONE stands beside a disconsolate SOMEONE.
8254	On screen the smoke is cleared and they see footage of a giant spider-like creature creeping out of a carriage.
8255	Hearing the siren, they look around in confusion.
8256	SOMEONE stops the projector and breaks the film off.
8257	Outside, there is chaos on the streets as people and military personnel hurry to and fro.

8266	People are aboard one of the buses.
8267	The convoy eventually arrives at Greenville Air Force Base.
8268	The vehicles cue to get in through the east entrance.
8269	Inside, the civilians disembark from the buses in a huge hanger.
8270	The Air Force personnel shepherds them along.
8271	SOMEONE wanders through the hanger looking for SOMEONE.
8272	He sees SOMEONE lying on a bed in a sick bay area.
8273	He goes over to him.
8274	SOMEONE looks relieved.
8275	SOMEONE finds people.
8276	To SOMEONE the camera shop guy.
8277	SOMEONE looks around.
8278	An armed guard opens the door.
8279	The guard escorts him along a corridor.
8280	He punches the guard out and takes his gun.
8281	Now dressed in the guard's uniform and clutching his rifle, SOMEONE trots along a corridor and makes his way through a couple of offices.
8282	He looks outside and spots a fuel tanker nearby.
8283	SOMEONE shoots the tanker which explodes in a fireball.
8284	Once Air Force personnel are distracted, SOMEONE helps himself to a Jeep and drives off.
8285	He motors along an un-metaled track running through open fields.
8286	He pulls up near a grain silo and gets out of the Jeep.
8287	He sees a convoy of vehicles traveling along an adjacent road.
8288	SOMEONE gets back in the Jeep.
8289	Now on a main carriage way, he unwittingly motors past people and the boys who are driving back to town.
8290	SOMEONE takes a sharp right onto a rough track through the trees.
8291	As it's getting dark, they arrive back into town.
8292	They drive until SOMEONE Middle School.
8293	The boys leave SOMEONE in the car park and scramble over a chain link fence.
8294	They run to a storage trailer.
8295	SOMEONE begins prying a padlock on the trailer with the tire iron.
8296	SOMEONE opens it.
8297	There are papers and rolls of film inside.

8301	Scientists and military men look at the wreckage of something big.
8302	SOMEONE puts a tape in a player.
8303	On the film, SOMEONE is grabbed by a tentacle.

8315	A boy recognizes him.
8316	SOMEONE finds SOMEONE reading a magazine.
8317	The super eight footage of the alien.
8318	On the bus the boys are in, SOMEONE hands SOMEONE some paperwork.
8319	The boys watch anxiously from a holding cell at the rear of the bus.
8320	Something hit the side of the bus, jolting it over onto two wheels.
8321	It continues along the road a short way like this before righting itself.
8322	As it does so, one of its tires blows out.
8323	The driver brings the bus to a grinding halt on a remote road.
8324	A rifle.
8325	SOMEONE hands the rifle to an apprehensive looking SOMEONE.
8326	The senior airman driving the bus hesitates before reluctantly obeying the order and opening the door.
8327	Outside it's pitch dark.
8328	Clutching the rifle, SOMEONE cautiously makes his way along the aisle of the bus towards the open door.
8329	As he nears the door, SOMEONE stops.
8330	A tentacle reaches into the bus and grabs SOMEONE.
8331	The boys watch in horror as it slaps him against the walls of the bus.
8332	The rifle goes off hitting the window of the boys holding cell.
8333	SOMEONE is dragged outside.
8334	SOMEONE vomits.
8335	The senior airman restarts the bus's engine and it lurches into life.
8336	As he stamps on the throttle, the bus is tipped onto its side.
8337	The boys pick themselves up.
8338	SOMEONE tries to open the back door.
8339	In the main body of the bus, a technical sergeant has been knocked cold.
8340	SOMEONE picks himself up.
8341	The alien rocks the bus as SOMEONE gets on the radio.
8342	SOMEONE tries to open the holding cell door but it's locked.

8344	A tentacle reaches in and crushes the driver.
8345	SOMEONE pounds on a cracked window above them.
8346	SOMEONE loads an assault rifle.
8347	SOMEONE breaks the window with his elbow and climbs out onto the side of the bus.
8348	At the front, the giant spider like alien is busy trying to reach in to get SOMEONE.
8349	SOMEONE helps SOMEONE out of the broken window followed by SOMEONE, and then SOMEONE.
8350	SOMEONE fires at the alien with the assault rifle as it forces its way into the bus.
8351	The boys clamor down from the vehicle and run off the road to cover.
8352	The alien closes in on SOMEONE apparently undeterred by the automatic fire.
8353	SOMEONE runs out of ammunition.
8354	The alien lunges at him with his needle sharp teeth.
8355	Lying in a ditch, the boys watch as the alien leaps of the bus and disappears into the woods.
8356	Air Force soldiers grab SOMEONE in the evacuation center.
8357	SOMEONE retrieves his locket from SOMEONE's body.

8364	The boys get out of the car and flee.
8365	A soldier into his radio.
8366	The boys run.
8367	They hurry through a back garden shoving a washing line out of their way.
8368	They leap a fence then race through a gate onto the street.
8369	They see a tank being overturned.
8370	Soldiers flee from their own malfunctioning machines which randomly spray shells, missiles, and bullets around them.
8371	The boys flee through a playground from an out of control tank.
8372	They hurry up a hill and take refuge in a house as the tank smashes up the playground.
8373	The boys hurry upstairs in the house.
8374	SOMEONE looks out of a window.
8375	A shell strikes the house and the blast knocks the boys to the ground.
8376	They get back up.
8377	SOMEONE is about to strap up SOMEONE's leg, which has been broken in the explosion.
8378	People run to the building in the cemetery, where SOMEONE saw earth being thrown about.
8379	They try all the doors, but they are firmly locked.
8380	They break the doors open and step inside.
8381	A tunnel leads into the Earth.
8382	SOMEONE unzips his bag.
8383	A bunch of fireworks spill out.
8384	SOMEONE lights one of the sparklers and tosses it into the tunnel.
8385	It falls about 30 feet before touching the bottom.
8386	They stand at the edge of the pit, looking down.
8387	A Jeep motors along a quiet dark road.
8388	SOMEONE is driving.
8389	SOMEONE sits beside him.
8390	A troubled expression on his face, SOMEONE looks over at SOMEONE.
8391	SOMEONE keeps his eyes unflinchingly on the road ahead, but deep emotions boil beneath the surface.
8392	SOMEONE looks over at SOMEONE, who gives him the briefest of glances.
8393	At the cemetery, people climb down a rope into the tunnel that the alien has built.
8394	At the bottom, they light another sparkler and look around the gloomy tunnel.
8395	They hurry down the large bore tunnel.
8396	Up ahead is faint flickering light.
8397	People round a corner in the tunnel.
8398	Up ahead of them is a massive chamber cut into the subterranean rocks.
8399	They cautiously edge closer and peer into it.
8400	It's full of machinery and some kind of industrial scale construction is taking place.
8401	As they creep a bit closer, they come across the sheriff hanging upside down from the roof of the tunnel.
8402	He is either dead or unconscious.
8403	SOMEONE claps his hand over SOMEONE's mouth to stop him from screaming.
8404	More bodies hang from the ceiling.
8405	They look round at the bodies, all suspended upside down from the ceiling.
8406	None of them is moving.
8407	The alien appears in the chamber.
8408	They watch as it does something behind some machinery.
8409	They notice the creature is holding what appears to be a severed human leg.
8410	It scuttles off.
8411	SOMEONE spots SOMEONE dangling upside down.
8412	SOMEONE hurries away back up the tunnel, using a sparkler to light his way.
8413	SOMEONE empties out his bag of pyrotechnics.
8414	SOMEONE arrives at a fork in the tunnel and chooses which way to go.
8415	SOMEONE selects some suitably noisy fireworks and watches as the alien sets to work on whatever it is it's building.
8416	SOMEONE is still dangling, motionless, upside down.
8417	The fork in the tunnel brings SOMEONE out quite close to her.
8418	He watches as the alien continues with its work.
8419	SOMEONE tries to get his lighter to spark up.
8420	The alien carries on working, oblivious to SOMEONE or SOMEONE.
8421	It stops what it's doing and takes SOMEONE down from where she is hanging.
8422	SOMEONE watches with mounting alarm.
8423	SOMEONE finally sparks his Zippo into life.
8424	He lights a firecracker and leaves it beside a pile of other fireworks, then legs it off back down the tunnel.
8425	The alien puts SOMEONE down and immediately goes to investigate the noise.
8426	SOMEONE breaks cover and runs over to SOMEONE, who lies un-moving on the chamber floor.
8427	She is completely unresponsive.
8428	SOMEONE hesitates, then slaps her hard.
8429	She wakes.
8430	She stares at him, then hugs him, tight.
8431	SOMEONE looks taken aback, but pleasantly so.
8432	A girl, SOMEONE, sits up nearby.
8433	They carefully lower the sheriff.
8434	The alien runs along the dark tunnel in pursuit of SOMEONE, who flees up ahead of it.
8435	The alien suddenly stops in its tracks.
8436	The sheriff is up on his feet.
8437	People follow the sheriff through the alien's maze of equipment.
8438	The sheriff shines his flashlight ahead of them.
8439	SOMEONE rounds the corner.
8440	The alien grabs the sheriff.
8441	The others flee.
8442	Bringing up the rear, SOMEONE is snatched by the creature and pulled back into the darkness.
8443	It comes after SOMEONE and the others.
8444	The three friends run on down a dark tunnel until they come to a dead end and are forced to stop.
8445	The alien emerges from the shadows.
8446	People cower back from it.
8447	SOMEONE stands his ground as it draws closer.
8448	The alien draws itself up to its full height of about 25 feet and SOMEONE steps towards it.
8449	The alien cocks its head to one side.
8450	The others look on in horror as the alien picks SOMEONE up.
8451	It holds him close to its face to get a look at him.
8452	The creature has a skull-like face with huge mandibles.
8453	The alien's breath ruffles SOMEONE's hair as it breathes on him.
8454	It leans in close and retracts some protective membranes from over its eyes and its expression softens.
8455	Hearing the machinery, the alien looks away for a moment, then turns back to SOMEONE.
8456	SOMEONE watches warily as the alien puts SOMEONE back on the ground.
8457	It turns and runs away back up the tunnel, on its many legs.
8458	SOMEONE stares after it, catching his breath.
8459	Now back on the surface, people join troops on a street in town.
8460	Strange magnetic force pulls metal items up off the ground and draws them towards the water tower.
8461	A bin, oil barrels, a table lamp, a bicycle and numerous other objects are all drawn irresistibly towards the tower.
8462	The items stick to the side of the structure.
8463	A shop window bursts open and television sets are hoovered up into the air.
8464	A soldier finds his rifle relentlessly drawn to the tower.
8465	He hangs onto it and is lifted up off the ground.
8466	He is pulled about 20 feet into the air before letting go.
8467	A car rises up out of the used car lot.
8468	Suddenly, the back of one of the military container lorries bursts open and the white cubes flood out of it.
8469	People have to dive onto the ground as the cubes pass overhead.
8470	The cubes, cars and other bits and pieces begin to fuse together, forming a gigantic structure on top of the tower.
8471	People pick themselves up and watch as a steady stream of metallic bits and pieces stream up towards the water tower and are melded into the ever growing structure on top of it.
8472	SOMEONE smiles as the vast structure begins to take shape.
8473	A Jeep drives up and SOMEONE sees his dad and SOMEONE get out of it.
8474	SOMEONE looks up at the water tower, then spots SOMEONE.
8475	SOMEONE nudges SOMEONE, who looks round and sees her dad with SOMEONE.
8476	The dads walk towards them and people go to meet them.
8477	SOMEONE cups SOMEONE's face in his hands, then hugs him tight, their faces tense with a mixture of emotion and relief.
8478	Eyes closed, they hold each other tight.
8479	SOMEONE looks over at her father as he steps up to her.
8480	They regard each other for a moment, then hug.
8481	SOMEONE looks over SOMEONE's shoulder at the water tower and sees the alien climbing up it.
8482	The creature steps into the now fully formed spaceship it's created on top of the water tower and the door closes behind it.
8483	The spaceship powers up and several arms on it rotate.
8484	Many bright lights on the arms shine out.
8485	SOMEONE separates from his father and is just in time to grab his mother's locket, which is being drawn towards the tower.
8486	It hangs in the air, pulled by an invisible force.
8487	The locket clicks open, revealing the picture inside, which is of SOMEONE's mother, holding him as a baby.
8488	SOMEONE lets go of the locket's chain and it floats up towards the water tower.
8489	SOMEONE and the others watch as the locket sticks to the side of the tower.
8490	Suddenly, the tower explodes in a shower of water, deluging the street below.
8491	The spaceship, which resembles the canopy of a palm tree, lifts into the air.
8492	The water tower collapses and crashes down into the street, scattering soldiers standing there, and crushing their vehicles.
8493	He, people watch as the spacecraft gains altitude in a blaze of bright lights.
8494	Hobbling through town, people sit sailing up into the night sky.
8495	Still stoned in his car, SOMEONE slumbers on as the spaceship flies by, its lights reflected in his windshield.
8496	As they watch it recede into the distance, people hold hands.
8497	Smiles spread across their faces.
8498	The spacecraft becomes a dot of light high up in the sky.
8499	Gradually, it becomes a pinpoint and then dies away altogether.
8500	A chalk outline of a body is drawn on the floor.
8501	SOMEONE arrives as the detective and talks to a witness.
8502	At Romero Chemicals.
8503	SOMEONE gets up and puts his hat on.
8504	SOMEONE, as the President, makes a call.
8505	SOMEONE goes on into building 47.

8507	Blood pours from SOMEONE's mouth.
8508	SOMEONE makes a phone call.
8509	At the station.
8510	SOMEONE's modern train is unconvincingly blown up.
8511	People are on the hillside overlooking the crash site.
8512	The man turns around.
8513	It's zombie SOMEONE again.
8514	SOMEONE pulls a gun and plugs him full of bullets.
8515	SOMEONE dictates.
8516	He knocks back a drink.
8517	Outside SOMEONE's house.
8518	SOMEONE is playing a doctor.
8519	The innocent victim, zombie SOMEONE, pops up and attacks SOMEONE.
8520	SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE again, but not before he is bitten into SOMEONE' shoulder.
8521	SOMEONE collapses with a bullet wound in his head.
8522	Now un-dead, SOMEONE lunges at SOMEONE, who shoots him, too.
8523	SOMEONE takes the syringe of antidote and goes.
8524	As he opens the door, zombie SOMEONE creeps up behind him.
8525	She rushes him as he turns around and he drops the syringe.
8526	As they grapple, SOMEONE reaches for the syringe and injects SOMEONE in the neck with it.
8527	She slumps, motionless.
8528	SOMEONE draws his gun.
8529	He is about to pull the trigger, but seeing she has been returned to normal, drops the gun.
8530	SOMEONE does an Orson Welles style epilogue.
8531	He closes a book and pretends to smoke a pipe.
8532	SOMEONE attacks him and snarls into the camera.
8533	A bright white light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long, white robe with a blue sash draped around her.
8534	She stands on a cliff before a cloudy sky.
8535	A boy leaps off a jetty towards a lake and is frozen in midair.
8536	The traffic helicopter for a local news program flies over Sacramento, California.
8537	Names appear beside the white silhouetted symbols for a woman, then a man.
8538	The symbols have red hearts on them.
8539	A young woman comes out of her house, talking on her phone.
8540	A phone rings.
8541	The smart, attractive, blonde woman, SOMEONE, arrives at work at the local TV station, KSXP.
8542	A control room.
8543	A cooking show on a studio set.
8544	Technical director, Cliff, turns to SOMEONE.
8545	The chef swigs wine from a bottle.
8546	SOMEONE has a swig.
8547	SOMEONE's boss, SOMEONE, switches off his monitors.
8548	In the toilet.
8549	In a restaurant, SOMEONE sits at a table with the guy.
8550	SOMEONE takes out his profile.
8551	He looks peeved.
8552	Later that night, SOMEONE walks past an illuminated fountain.
8553	She heads along a path through the pretty ornamental gardens outside her apartment building.
8554	She lets herself in her front door, and her cat, D'Artagnan, trots over.
8555	SOMEONE looks thoughtful and a little sad.
8556	As she gets ready for bed, a TV plays in her bedroom.
8557	D'Artagnan treads on the remote and changes channels.
8558	He gobbles a marshmallow on the end of a long skewer.
8559	He slurps a coffee.
8560	She looks at SOMEONE, haughtily.
8561	Grinning, he shakes her hand.
8562	SOMEONE paces in her office.
8563	She rolls her eyes.
8564	On the studio lot.
8565	He gets between them.

8670	SOMEONE steps out of her apartment.
8671	On the doormat is a gift bag.
8672	SOMEONE picks it up and looks around, frowning.

8674	She opens the card.
8675	She takes a box from the gift bag.
8676	She opens the box.

8678	SOMEONE stands in front of the mirror and applies lipstick.
8679	SOMEONE perches on the arm of a chair.
8680	She sips a glass of white wine, and glances at the vibrating briefs, and considers for a moment.

8682	As she does so, D'Artagnan the cat trots past and climbs onto a chair.
8683	SOMEONE picks up the black, lacy vibrating briefs and puts them on.
8684	SOMEONE pulls up the briefs and straightens out her dress.
8685	D'Artagnan the cat stares at her as she picks up the small, cylindrical remote control unit.
8686	She puts her briefs and the box for the vibrating briefs behind a cushion, stuffs the remote control in her handbag, and opens the door.

8688	She smiles bitterly.
8689	In SOMEONE's car.

8714	They clink glasses and drink wine.
8715	SOMEONE teases SOMEONE with some caviar, then pops it into her mouth.
8716	He looks away.
8717	She chews, winces, spits the caviar out, and grimaces.
8718	SOMEONE quickly wipes her hand across her mouth, composes herself, and smiles at SOMEONE.

8721	In a coffee shop, SOMEONE buys coffees for people.

8724	On set, SOMEONE's spooning chocolate into the mouth of a sexy babe.
8725	A man delivers a bouquet of red roses to SOMEONE.
8726	Her mouth hangs open, and she and SOMEONE do a little dance.
8727	Seeing people so excited, SOMEONE's face falls.
8728	He turns back to the babe and sees he is smeared chocolate over her face.
8729	Distracted, he wipes it off.
8730	People sit in the SF Saloon and Grill.
8731	SOMEONE's on the phone.

8766	They smile and dance together, back and forth.
8767	SOMEONE spins SOMEONE and leads her.
8768	She steps away, holding his hands, and returns with her back to him.
8769	They sink down, moving their shoulders seductively from side to side.
8770	People clasp hands and hold each other round the waist.
8771	They turn, round and round, moving smoothly to the music.
8772	SOMEONE leans back on SOMEONE's arm, and they dance with their hands held palm to palm.

8774	SOMEONE sways rhythmically to the music as SOMEONE caresses her hair and runs his hands down her sides.
8775	SOMEONE spins out, swishing her hair round.

8777	SOMEONE wraps her arms around SOMEONE's neck, and they dance close.
8778	He spins her back and forth, then pulls her closer.

8787	SOMEONE turns and faces SOMEONE.
8788	They both fidget awkwardly.
8789	They step into the elevator and stand side by side.
8790	SOMEONE presses buttons and loosens his jacket.
8791	She flashes a smile at him.
8792	They hug.
8793	He stops the doors closing.
8794	They hug again.
8795	People suddenly wrap their arms around each other and kiss hungrily.
8796	SOMEONE presses SOMEONE against the edge of the open door.
8797	The doors close.
8798	SOMEONE's mouth hangs open, and he walks off, looking shocked.
8799	SOMEONE lets herself into her room, looking equally surprised.
8800	She lets her jacket and bag fall to the floor, drops her key on a table, and flops onto a couch, frowning.
8801	She takes off her shoes and flings them aside.
8802	SOMEONE leaps to her feet, smooths out her tight-fitting beige dress, and goes to the door.
8803	She opens the door and looks horrified.
8804	They kiss.
8805	SOMEONE's shirt is covered in champagne.
8806	He takes it off, revealing his toned chest.
8807	SOMEONE marches along a corridor.

8821	SOMEONE walks into the room.
8822	SOMEONE's sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing a fresh, unbuttoned shirt.
8823	SOMEONE sips and SOMEONE gulps her champagne.
8824	With tears in her eyes, SOMEONE steps away, drinks, and sits.
8825	SOMEONE looks uncomfortable and buttons up his shirt.
8826	SOMEONE puts down her glass and steps towards him.
8827	SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE.
8828	She reaches up and undoes her long, blonde hair extension piece.
8829	SOMEONE frowns as she takes it off, leaving her real hair, which falls, tousled, onto her shoulders.
8830	She runs her hand over her hair and sighs.
8831	Morning, at KSXP, SOMEONE looks anxious.
8832	SOMEONE walks up to SOMEONE.
8833	At the other station, a squat, young guy.
8834	Sunlight glistens on a lake.
8835	Mountains rise up on the horizon.
8836	Several colorful hot-air balloons hang in midair with baskets suspended beneath.
8837	Gawky SOMEONE stands in a hot-air balloon.
8838	Flames spew from the burner above his head.
8839	He points his finger like a gun.
8840	In the control room.
8841	SOMEONE yanks him out.
8842	SOMEONE gets in the basket.
8843	The balloon fires up.
8844	SOMEONE leans over and sees how high they are.
8845	The camera on the basket frame films people.
8846	They stand grumpily, side by side.
8847	As the balloon rises, SOMEONE looks around.
8848	Many more balloons float in the clear, blue sky.
8849	Below is the mirror-like surface of the lake, surrounded by lush forest.
8850	SOMEONE looks around.
8851	The pilot holds up a bottle of champagne.
8852	SOMEONE looks up.
8853	SOMEONE loosens his collar.
8854	SOMEONE's expression softens, and she looks away for a moment.
8855	She looks at SOMEONE and narrows her eyes, skeptically.
8856	He just stares at her.
8857	SOMEONE looks away, and SOMEONE studies him for a moment.
8858	SOMEONE clasps her hands around his face and kisses him passionately.
8859	They wrap their arms around each other.
8860	As they embrace, SOMEONE turns SOMEONE around, and they lean against the side of the basket.
8861	He waves his hand dismissively at the pilot, who turns and looks the other way.
8862	SOMEONE turns the light on and sits up, soaked in sweat.
8863	SOMEONE beams at him.
8864	Now, a shower with steamy glass doors blur our view of a couple having sex.
8865	As the woman gets out, her partner follows.
8866	A title appears with an arrow pointing at the woman's face.
8867	Now, the man opens the door and finds an adolescent girl with a massive golden-brown curl sleeping face-down in bed.
8868	In a t-shirt and boxers, the man lumbers over to the bed and lightly touches her arm.
8869	As she lies unresponsive, he barrages her with lazy slaps.
8870	She reaches a hand out.
8871	He kisses her cheek.
8872	Later, he lies close to a little blonde girl and kisses her cheek.
8873	He carries her down the hall.
8874	Now, the older girl makes bacon and scrambled eggs as her father brings in big, colorful balloons.
8875	He sneaks some bacon, drinks OJ from the plastic jug and eats a cupcake.
8876	His youngest sets off a confetti shooter.
8877	Another room, the wife and mother sits at a window with a towel over her hair.
8878	She smokes a cigarette with a latex-gloved hand.
8879	Meanwhile, her family hangs streamers, sets out presents and puts candles shaped like the number 38 on a cake.
8880	Putting the cigarette out, she uncovers her hair, removes the glove and pops gum in her mouth.
8881	She pats her face and hands with a wipe, then sprays herself with perfume.
8882	Now, she leans into the kitchen.
8883	The youngest shoots confetti.
8884	She blows out her birthday candles.
8885	Later, the girls sit on a couch a few yards from the kitchen island where their parents relax.
8886	SOMEONE stabs his older companion.
8887	Their father takes a cup of berries to the sink.
8888	He faces his wife.
8889	He runs water over the cupcake.
8890	Now in the room, the younger daughter plays a larger keyboard.
8891	Her sister throws clothes at a closet.
8892	Wearing biking gear, he kisses her goodbye then sneaks over to the kitchen sink.
8893	Extracting the cupcake from a soggy bed of scrambled eggs, he unwraps the tainted treat.
8894	He glances toward the open front door, then takes a bite.
8895	Now, a lanky man leads the woman and a plump brunette up an outdoor flight of stairs at a brisk jog.
8896	The brunette lags behind.
8897	Now, a goateed man bicycles with the father.
8898	A car darts out and nearly hits them.
8899	Now, his wife does crunches.
8900	The plump woman bounces on a stability ball.
8901	SOMEONE's features pinch up.
8902	He affects a lonely, pitiful gaze.
8903	In a coffeehouse.
8904	SOMEONE gives an earnest nod.
8905	Now, in an SUV, he sings to his wife.
8906	Her sister grabs at the tablet.
8907	Now, in a shopping district.
8908	As SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE, SOMEONE smiles at stunning SOMEONE, who works on a ladder.
8909	SOMEONE nods behind her large, round glasses.
8910	At the front of the store, SOMEONE hangs a Christmas garland.
8911	Smiling, SOMEONE nods.
8912	With a concerned expression, he rejoins his wife at the counter.
8913	SOMEONE faces a middle-aged man.
8914	Now, on a backyard trampoline, SOMEONE's youngest does a flip.
8915	People look on.
8916	Sitting on a toilet, SOMEONE plays online Scrabble.
8917	SOMEONE opens the door.
8918	She lifts her brow with a skeptical nod.
8919	SOMEONE snatches his computer tablet and leaves.
8920	SOMEONE stands onstage.
8921	In the audience, SOMEONE's goateed friend and SOMEONE share a table with SOMEONE.
8922	The silver-haired man in the amber-tinted glasses takes the stage with a backup musician.
8923	At the table, SOMEONE sits by his wife, his boyishly ardent gaze fixed on the stage.
8924	SOMEONE sighs.
8925	Bobbing his head, the music producer mouths along with the lyrics.
8926	SOMEONE turns away discreetly to yawn.
8927	SOMEONE briefly lip syncs at her.
8928	SOMEONE's eyes close.
8929	Later, SOMEONE drives his wife home.
8930	SOMEONE pulls over as the fire truck passes in the opposite direction.
8931	SOMEONE watches with a smirk as two other emergency vehicles drive by.
8932	Back at home, they enter SOMEONE's room.
8933	She takes SOMEONE's MP3 player.
8934	She sets it in a dock.
8935	SOMEONE smiles as her mother dances.
8936	SOMEONE bounces up and down.
8937	SOMEONE grins, then bops her head as she gets up and joins them.
8938	Looking on, SOMEONE takes a seat as his wife and daughters dance.
8939	Standing, SOMEONE replaces SOMEONE's music player with his own.
8940	SOMEONE and the girls halt.
8941	As his wife and daughters look on, SOMEONE sways awkwardly, letting his head rock side to side.
8942	SOMEONE gestures toward their glum-faced daughters.
8943	Eyeing them, SOMEONE takes his music player from the speaker dock.
8944	In the morning, SOMEONE rushes to the kitchen island, where SOMEONE eats breakfast with the girls.
8945	Preparing their lunches, she glares at her husband.
8946	Later, SOMEONE runs upstairs.
8947	Now, at a school.
8948	People pass a pregnant woman with long, gray hair.
8949	They reach a classroom.
8950	SOMEONE hugs an old woman.
8951	Later, SOMEONE ducks down in her car as she smokes a cigarette.
8952	She blows smoke out the window and pulls away.
8953	Now, a laptop shows a young SOMEONE performing in his heyday.
8954	SOMEONE watches with a mustached 30-something and a hip, young woman.
8955	He glances toward his office.
8956	In the office.
8957	SOMEONE heads out.
8958	Now, at a home office.
8959	SOMEONE plucks a sitar.
8960	At night, SOMEONE faces a laptop as she and SOMEONE lounge in bed.
8961	They view video from the store.
8962	SOMEONE's hook-up takes her from behind.
8963	SOMEONE averts her face.
8964	She hits SOMEONE with a pillow.
8965	Now, SOMEONE bounces in the doorway across the bathroom between the girls' rooms.
8966	Her own hand snatches her out of view and she collapses with her feet sticking out.
8967	They slowly drag out of view.
8968	SOMEONE focuses on her homework.
8969	Playing air guitar, SOMEONE advances toward SOMEONE's bed, then retreats to the doorway and flings one arm out.
8970	Her sister ignores her.
8971	Leaving the door open, SOMEONE sulks away.
8972	Now, SOMEONE steps out of a side door and opens a trash bin.
8973	She breaks up a pack of cigarettes and throws them away.
8974	She overturns a small pouch into the bin.
8975	She goes back inside.
8976	SOMEONE comes out the same door with a plate carrying three cupcakes.
8977	Setting it aside, he opens the trash bin and overturns a large jar of candy.
8978	He throws the cupcakes in one at a time.
8979	SOMEONE pauses at the last cupcake and takes a deep breath.
8980	He unwraps the cupcake, then takes a large bite.
8981	He starts to throw the rest in, then hesitates and takes another bite.
8982	Chewing blissfully, he holds the remainder over the trash.
8983	SOMEONE leans in, devours the treat, and throws the last bite away.
8984	Now, he jogs on a treadmill with electrodes dotting his bare chest.
8985	In another exam room, a technician positions SOMEONE at a mammogram machine.
8986	A doctor stands close with his hand up SOMEONE's hospital gown.
8987	In another office.
8988	Now, she sits in a dentist's chair.
8989	Now, SOMEONE's doctor snaps on a latex glove as SOMEONE leans over a table.
8990	His doctor bends close from behind, thrusts his finger out of view and works it around.
8991	Now, SOMEONE sits with her feet in stirrups.
8992	Two women enter separately.
8993	The doctor winks.
8994	Now, at home.
8995	SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in a sitting room.
8996	Trying the sitting room door, SOMEONE finds it locked.
8997	SOMEONE moves away.
8998	Now, a gray-haired man steps out of a modest house.
8999	SOMEONE approaches as a plane passes overhead.
9000	They hug.
9001	Now, they sit in a living room.
9002	SOMEONE smiles tightly as his dad cuddles the little blonde boy.
9003	Two more boys arrive identical to the first.

9455	He points his wand at SOMEONE.
9456	SOMEONE leaves the house dragging his trunk on a small set of wheels.
9457	In the distance, SOMEONE is a faint speck in the darkening sky.
9458	SOMEONE walks quickly, breathing hard as he pulls the heavy trunk along the deserted streets.
9459	The street lights are reflected in the puddles on the damp pavements.
9460	At last, he slows down and looks around him.
9461	Ahead is a small patch of worn grass in a children's playground.
9462	He is alone.
9463	He sits wearily on the edge of the pavement, hunching his shoulders against the cold and damp.
9464	He looks up as the streetlight above his head flickers and goes out.
9465	In the playground, the empty swings begin to move.
9466	The roundabout turns and a seesaw clumps down onto the grass.
9467	In front of him, a huge black dog looms out of the bushes.
9468	SOMEONE slowly rises to his feet.
9469	SOMEONE pulls out his wand and stumbles backwards onto the pavement.
9470	A bright light approaches.

9497	SOMEONE follows SOMEONE into the Leaky Cauldron.
9498	Inside the gloomy public house, a man sits reading a book while a spoon stirs itself around a cup.
9499	Chairs turn themselves upside down onto the tables.
9500	In a room upstairs, SOMEONE finds his snowy owl and the Minister for Magic, SOMEONE.
9501	As SOMEONE hauls him up, SOMEONE calls his owl.
9502	SOMEONE gazes down at the busy marketplace below his window.
9503	A high-level train rattles past.
9504	SOMEONE goes to the pile of books on the low table by the fire.
9505	One of the books is growling.
9506	He looks at its hairy cover, staring, glassy eyes and sharp, pointed teeth.
9507	Suddenly, the book goes berserk, snapping its covers.
9508	It leaps out of his hands and starts to snap at his feet.
9509	SOMEONE jumps up onto the bed.
9510	The book scurries underneath in a flurry of torn paper.
9511	SOMEONE lies down and peers under the bed.
9512	The book lies still, then snaps once more and slithers out, turning this way and that.
9513	It slides back under the bed.
9514	SOMEONE quickly unties his shoelace and dangles his shoe over the edge of the bed.
9515	He drops his shoe onto the floor and the book hurtles out, snapping its covers.

9526	SOMEONE peers along the corridor.
9527	The door slides shut.
9528	The lights go out.
9529	SOMEONE stares out of the window into the rain.
9530	The Express has stopped on a viaduct.
9531	One by one, the carriages go dark.
9532	The train lurches again.
9533	The air has turned so cold that they can see their breath.
9534	SOMEONE pulls his hand away from the window as frost spreads across the glass.
9535	Ice forms in SOMEONE's bottle of water.
9536	He is still asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak.
9537	The train lurches again.
9538	SOMEONE shivers.
9539	Something appears out in the corridor floating towards the door, something black, shapeless and mysterious.
9540	It reaches out.
9541	The door slides open and a horrible hand with long fingers like crooked, dead twigs reaches around it into the compartment.
9542	A hooded black shape looms in the doorway.
9543	SOMEONE's cat spits.
9544	SOMEONE's rat, Scabbers, hides under his coat.
9545	The hideous cloaked figure floats into the compartment and faces SOMEONE.
9546	He stares helplessly at the terrifying creature.
9547	It seems to draw the energy out of him.
9548	His body goes stiff.
9549	SOMEONE throws off his cloak and points his wand at the threatening figure.
9550	In a flash of light, it hurtles backwards and disappears.
9551	SOMEONE loses consciousness.
9552	SOMEONE opens his eyes.

9561	Horseless carriages take the students up to Hogwarts Castle.
9562	They assemble in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast.
9563	Lighted candles hang above their heads as they sit at the long tables listening to the choir.
9564	Each singer in the front row holds a huge toad.
9565	SOMEONE stands and nods to the students.
9566	SOMEONE, the huge giant stands up, knocking into the table.
9567	He extinguishes a candle.
9568	The candle relights itself.
9569	Leaving the Hall.
9570	SOMEONE and his friends climb the moving staircase towards a portrait of a fat lady holding a glass and singing.

9574	The boys try magic sweets.
9575	SOMEONE chews the sweet.
9576	SOMEONE tries one.
9577	Steam shoots from SOMEONE's ears.
9578	Outside the window, the rain lashes down.
9579	Lightning flashes.
9580	As the storm rages around Hogwarts Castle, the black- cloaked Dementors hover outside the grounds of the school.
9581	A small bird flies along the stone cloister.
9582	It swoops down a grassy slope towards a crooked willow tree.
9583	The tree pulls back a branch and thwacks the bird.
9584	Feathers fly.
9585	A classroom.
9586	She recoils.
9587	Outside the school.
9588	The students follow SOMEONE around the edge of the sunlit forest to a grassy clearing surrounded by a low wall.
9589	SOMEONE strokes his monster book, and it purrs contentedly.

9610	SOMEONE hangs on desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck.
9611	The four-legged creature, half-horse, half-eagle, rises above the trees.
9612	In the distance, SOMEONE can see a river winding its way down the valley, the strong wings of the hippogriff carrying them even higher.
9613	They sail between the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School and soar above the craggy hillside.
9614	The silvery sun filters down through the storm clouds turning the waters of a vast lake below them to a steely gray.
9615	Clinging to the creature's neck, SOMEONE sees his reflection in the water as Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one huge claw just touching the surface.
9616	SOMEONE relaxes, enjoying the sensation.
9617	A huge smile crosses his face and he spreads his arms wide.
9618	SOMEONE grabs hold of the feathery neck once more as the huge wings lift them up and away from the lake.
9619	At last, SOMEONE calls them back.

9632	A Dementor floats past.
9633	Frost appears on the petals and the flower immediately dies.
9634	A wardrobe.
9635	He whispers to SOMEONE.
9636	The wardrobe door slowly opens and SOMEONE steps out.
9637	SOMEONE is dressed as an old lady with a red handbag.
9638	SOMEONE is pushed to the front.
9639	SOMEONE steps forward, reluctantly.
9640	SOMEONE becomes a huge, black spider.
9641	SOMEONE's hair stands on end as it moves towards him, clicking its pincers.

9655	SOMEONE talks to SOMEONE.
9656	SOMEONE grins, proudly.
9657	On the staircase.

9659	Weeping and wailing, the painted characters run from picture to picture.
9660	People, the caretaker, stare at the empty painting.
9661	SOMEONE runs his finger across the slashed canvas as SOMEONE looks around, suspiciously.
9662	In a picture of the African plains, the fat lady hides behind a hippopotamus.
9663	The heavy portcullis is lowered.
9664	The huge gates are closed and firmly secured by a system of strong iron locks, which swing neatly into place, one after the other.
9665	The Dementors keep guard outside the school as all of the students sleep in the Great Hall.
9666	SOMEONE is wide-awake and listening.
9667	On the ceiling of the Great Hall, a star shoots across the celestial sky.
9668	A single autumn leaf flutters down from the Whomping Willow, then all the leaves fall at once and the tree shakes its bare branches.

9679	Wearing goggles as protection from the rain, SOMEONE swoops past the stand where the professors follow the action.
9680	He keeps close behind the Hufflepuff seeker as they both spot the Golden Snitch.
9681	As SOMEONE reaches out to grab it, lightning catapults him backwards on his broomstick.
9682	SOMEONE peers into the hazy clouds.
9683	Looming above him, they form the menacing shape of a huge, black dog.
9684	He hovers for a moment until the Golden Snitch appears in front of him.
9685	He makes a grab for it but it zooms sharply away.
9686	SOMEONE swerves back to follow it.
9687	As he reaches out, thick ice begins to form on the handle of his broomstick.

9844	She is turned upside down.
9845	SOMEONE finds his glasses and puts them on to see SOMEONE flying towards him.
9846	Desperately, she grabs hold of his T-shirt.

9848	They hurtle around until SOMEONE lets go and SOMEONE falls down the hole under the tree roots.
9849	SOMEONE lands on top of him.
9850	Ahead of them is a flight of steps cut into the twisted roots.
9851	They start to climb.
9852	People climb up through a trapdoor under bare floorboards.
9853	A faint light filters through wooden shutters.
9854	They go up a rickety staircase and along a dingy landing.
9855	In a dilapidated room.

9900	It howls to the moon.
9901	SOMEONE appears.
9902	The werewolf lashes out at him.
9903	The black dog leaps out of the shadows.
9904	It knocks the werewolf to the ground.
9905	The animals face each other growling, then both leap to the attack.
9906	They collide in mid air, then fall, snarling and biting.
9907	The dog runs off, chased by the werewolf.
9908	SOMEONE follows and sees the werewolf hurling the dog against a rock.
9909	SOMEONE throws a stone and hits the werewolf on the back of the head.
9910	It turns slowly and lopes menacingly towards him.
9911	It stops and lifts its head.
9912	It runs towards the sound of the howling.
9913	From where the dog fell, a figure gets up and limps away through the bushes.
9914	SOMEONE follows the figure, hurrying through the trees towards the moonlit lake.
9915	He runs down the bank and across the stony shore to the edge of the water.
9916	SOMEONE is lying on his back, his eyes closed, a bloody claw mark on his shoulder.
9917	The water lapping the shore stops moving as a sheet of crackling ice spreads over the surface of the lake.
9918	SOMEONE opens his eyes and shudders with horror.
9919	SOMEONE looks up.
9920	A swarm of hooded Dementors are circling above their heads, their black cloaks fluttering behind them.
9921	One swoops down and attacks SOMEONE.
9922	SOMEONE pulls out his wand and points it at the Dementors.
9923	A silver mist forms a protective shield and the Dementors are held back.
9924	But the power of SOMEONE's wand fades and the Dementors return to the attack.
9925	He cries out in horror as he falls back onto the stony beach beside SOMEONE.
9926	Again, the Dementors circle overhead, then swoop lower and lower, hovering over the two figures lying helpless below as life is gradually sucked out of them.
9927	A faint, silvery breath floats from SOMEONE' half-open mouth, illuminating his face.
9928	Exhausted, SOMEONE lifts his head.
9929	To his surprise, the Dementors are floating harmlessly.
9930	He sees something shining on the far side of the frozen lake.
9931	Glowing amongst the trees, a magnificent silver stag with huge antlers stands facing him.
9932	SOMEONE gazes at the beautiful animal.
9933	The dazzling light surrounding the stag grows even brighter.
9934	As the Dementors start to move again, they are turned back by a powerful invisible shield and swoop away over SOMEONE's head.
9935	A tiny, silvery breath floats back into SOMEONE' mouth and his chest heaves.
9936	He gives a great sigh.
9937	The light draws back across the lake.
9938	SOMEONE watches the bright light fade away, leaving only the faint image of a figure standing on the far shore.
9939	He falls back beside his godfather.
9940	They lie next to each other, sprawled unconscious on the stony beach.
9941	In the hospital wing.
9942	He pats SOMEONE's bandaged leg.
9943	He walks to the door.
9944	SOMEONE is wearing a long chain necklace.
9945	She puts it around SOMEONE's neck as well and spins its golden pendant.
9946	The room is filled with people moving backwards very fast.
9947	She replaces the necklace.
9948	The wheels of the great clock turn.
9949	They cross the quadrangle below and run along the cloister.
9950	She shows him the pendant.
9951	They hide.
9952	People creep out from their hiding place.
9953	SOMEONE looks around nervously as they run towards a huge stone.
9954	Standing behind it, they look down the hill.
9955	They watch themselves running along the path below towards SOMEONE's cottage and the pumpkin patch.
9956	People hurry down the path and hide behind the pile of pumpkins.
9957	People and the Executioner.
9958	She pulls him back out of sight.
9959	SOMEONE sees a pebble lying on the pumpkin in front of her.
9960	She throws the pebble through the window.
9961	She throws another.
9962	SOMEONE rubs his head.
9963	SOMEONE knocks at the front door.
9964	As the three men go inside, the back door opens.
9965	Quickly, they run into the forest and observe themselves and SOMEONE leave the cottage and hide behind the pumpkins.
9966	Pushing aside a branch, SOMEONE stares at herself in the past.
9967	The branch springs back.
9968	People watch themselves and SOMEONE run back up the hill, then they creep back into the garden.
9969	They peer towards the cottage.
9970	Crows peck at SOMEONE's feet as he steals across the garden.
9971	SOMEONE bows to Buckbeak, who lowers his head in return.
9972	SOMEONE stretches towards the post where Buckbeak is chained.
9973	A crow pecks his hand as he undoes the chain.
9974	Buckbeak won't move.
9975	SOMEONE throws the ferret.
9976	Buckbeak follows them into the forest.
9977	SOMEONE turns.
9978	The Executioner raises his axe and splits a pumpkin in frustration.
9979	People use the dead ferrets to lure Buckbeak deeper and deeper into the safety of the forest.
9980	Leaving the hippogriff in a clearing, they run out of the trees until they see the Whomping Willow in the distance, flailing its branches.
9981	SOMEONE points his wand and the tree falls still.
9982	He goes down under the roots.
9983	SOMEONE follows SOMEONE.
9984	They sit down beside each other on the grass.
9985	As darkness falls, a swarm of bats flutters through the forest.
9986	Buckbeak lifts his head, opens his beak and grabs a bat.
9987	The bats fly out into the open and swoop low over people's heads.
9988	They look back towards the hippogriff.
9989	In the distance, they see again the dog and the werewolf fighting by the willow tree.
9990	People run through the undergrowth.
9991	Ahead of them, the werewolf flings the dog against the rock.
9992	SOMEONE sees himself throwing a stone and the werewolf turning and advancing on him.
9993	SOMEONE howls.
9994	They race back the way they came through the moonlit forest, stumbling over the uneven ground.
9995	Close behind, the savage werewolf lopes easily after them.
9996	SOMEONE trips over a tree root.
9997	SOMEONE helps him up.
9998	Eventually, they stop to catch their breath, hiding behind the gnarled trunk of a huge tree.
9999	The werewolf sniffs the ground, then disappears around the other side of the tree.
10000	They look around cautiously.
10001	They creep away nervously.
10002	The vicious creature appears behind them.
10003	It moves forward and rears up, about to strike.
10004	Flapping his huge wings, Buckbeak attacks.
10005	He claws the werewolf with his talons and it slinks away.
10006	SOMEONE hides her face on SOMEONE's shoulder.
10007	A blast of air scatters the dry leaves at their feet.
10008	They look up.
10009	A swarm of Dementors is moving ominously across the sky.
10010	Holding SOMEONE's hand, SOMEONE leads the way towards the lake.
10011	On the stony shore at the far side, he sees himself and SOMEONE lying unconscious beside him.
10012	The hooded Dementors fly low over the frozen lake.
10013	The Dementors swoop down again and again as they attack the two helpless figures.
10014	The Dementors hover above SOMEONE.
10015	SOMEONE runs out from the trees.
10016	Standing at the edge of the lake, he points his wand, summoning all his strength.
10017	The wand pulsates with energy and a silver mist comes from it, forcing the Dementors back.
10018	The light from the wand glows even more strongly, forming a bright protective shield which spreads to the other side of the lake.
10019	The Dementors swirl angrily above his head, still trying to reach the figures on the opposite shore.
10020	SOMEONE concentrates even harder, and they retreat.
10021	He sees himself staring from the other side of the lake, then falling unconscious beside SOMEONE.
10022	The light from SOMEONE's wand fades.
10023	Buckbeak flies people back to the school.
10024	Swooping over Hogwarts Castle, the hippogriff glides down towards the dark tower where SOMEONE is imprisoned.
10025	SOMEONE opens the barred door of his cell.
10026	Buckbeak carries people away from the dark tower.
10027	Beating its huge wings, the hippogriff swoops down towards the ground.
10028	He lays his hand on SOMEONE's heart.
10029	SOMEONE climbs onto Buckbeak's back and smiles at SOMEONE.
10030	Buckbeak gallops across the quadrangle, flaps his wings, and takes off into the night sky.
10031	Silhouetted against the moon, he carries SOMEONE away to safety.
10032	Pulling SOMEONE after her, SOMEONE runs across the quadrangle into the school.
10033	They hurry upstairs past the huge clock.
10034	The great wheels turn as the clock chimes.
10035	As they run along the corridor towards the hospital wing, SOMEONE comes out and closes the door.
10036	They go inside.
10037	Two figures disappear from beside SOMEONE's bed.
10038	A bird flies towards the Whomping Willow.
10039	It disappears amongst the branches and feathers fall.
10040	SOMEONE climbs the stone staircase to SOMEONE's room.
10041	He goes to knock.
10042	A writing desk closes itself.
10043	A cabin trunk packs itself, folds up its contents neatly and closes.
10044	The Marauder's Map.
10045	SOMEONE points his wand and the parchment folds itself up and becomes blank.
10046	He smiles at SOMEONE, picks up his bag and walking stick, and leaves.
10047	SOMEONE goes to the door, as SOMEONE limps slowly out through the classroom below.
10048	The ghostly horsemen gallop through the Great Hall.
10049	SOMEONE unwraps the parcel.
10050	A hippogriff feather.
10051	In the quadrangle, SOMEONE sits astride his magnificent new Firebolt.
10052	His classmates cheer as he zooms up into the air.
10053	Hurtling above Hogwart's, SOMEONE shouts with exhilaration.
