553	Hector sits on the vet's lap.
554	Staff sergeant looks over the area and glances skyward.
555	The helicopter rises above the sandbag bunker and over the desolate lot.
556	As SOMEONE peers through a binocular, SOMEONE shifts his troubled gaze.
557	Beyond the chopper, scattered fires light up the sprawling city.
558	In distant downtown skyscrapers burn like Roman candles.
559	SOMEONE adjusts his helmet above his narrowed eyes.
560	The weary, disheveled group sits, huddled in the cabin.
561	As the teary eyed sisters sit together watching the war-torn city, SOMEONE eyes them.
562	Passengers brace themselves.
563	SOMEONE peers through his binocular.
564	The staff sergeant faces forward.

567	He covers her hand with his own and shakes it.
568	He leaves his seat and taps the crew chief.
569	He drops a long rope from the side door then faces Hector.

588	Glowing orange bases.
589	As the aliens leave, SOMEONE steps out of the shadows.
590	The group creeps forward, passing the glowing cones each of which holding three antenna-like spears in its peak.
591	An antenna shaft glows red as a crackle of electricity pulses out of it.
592	Halting the unit, SOMEONE watches the shadow of the departing alien then waves the others forward.
593	They reach an atrium in the tunnel system, where more of the glowing devices rest on its flooded floor.
594	SOMEONE glances over his shoulder, his eyes searching the hazy area.
595	He leans, knocks a panel off a wall as it drops, revealing a room on the other side.
596	SOMEONE gazes into the high ceiling chamber, where a giant craft sits inside.
597	It shapes similar to a balloon.
598	Two jacking towers jet from its tower, protruding through a hole in the ceiling.
599	They go away from the opening.
600	As an alien draws closer, the rest of the unit climbs up the street level.
601	SOMEONE holds the pin from a grenade.
602	The alien scoops it up and then it explodes.
603	Flames burst into the air behind SOMEONE and his unit.
604	They take cover behind and SOMEONE assembles a handheld laser target designator.
605	SOMEONE nods and SOMEONE eyes the others.
606	SOMEONE glances up at some soaring drums as he makes his way to a crumbled building.
607	They hide into a destroyed building, SOMEONE crouches in a doorway while SOMEONE adjusts her gun.
608	He climbs the stairs.
609	Racing up the remains of the building's only surviving stairwell, he takes out his radio.

639	SOMEONE lowers his empty rifle and draw his gun.
640	The aliens race away from the prevailing humans.
641	SOMEONE's chest heaves as he watches them disappear around the corner.
642	He sweeps his gaze over the area, finding it unoccupied then lowers his gun.
643	As drones continue to fall from the sky, columns of black smoke rise into the air from a flaming command center.
644	Sunlight shines behind SOMEONE's unit silhouetting them as they stand amidst the rubble and stare at the destroyed vessel.
645	Now SOMEONE and a handful of his comrades ride in the cabin of a helicopter.
646	He jumps down.
647	More Marines jog pass SOMEONE's group.
648	A commanding Marine heads over to them.
649	Now on a tent, SOMEONE chugs a bottle of water while SOMEONE pours one over his head then drinks.
650	With a tired look, SOMEONE sips her own bottle.
651	SOMEONE claps a hand on the back of SOMEONE's neck then they share a look.
652	Tears glisten in SOMEONE's eyes as he shifts his gaze to Harris, who clasps his weapon to his chest and clenches his jaw.
653	The staff sergeant eyes a supply of bullets and a stack of ammunition magazines sitting on a table.
654	He grabs a bullet and loads it into an empty clip.
655	As he fills the magazine, the others and his unit watch with disbelieving eyes.
656	SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a look.
657	The corpsman shifts his gaze to the staff sergeant.
658	SOMEONE steps up to the table.
659	As he gathers supplies, SOMEONE looks over and the corporal gives him a nod.
660	SOMEONE and SOMEONE join them.
661	Sunset reception, they wear gold medals.

669	Their rival's cold smile.
670	He holds his medal.
671	Now, a row of cannons fires beside a sign - Baily Yacht Club.
672	From a deck, the two brothers watch heading out to sea.
673	He rests his arm on SOMEONE's shoulders as they gaze out at the water.
674	SOMEONE nods.
675	SOMEONE pulls him into a hug and tousles his hair.
676	Now, in a car's passenger seat, a blonde uses a vanity mirror to apply lipstick.
677	SOMEONE looks back and forth between his mother and brother.
678	Their mother gazes wistfully out her window.
679	Now, the car rolls.
680	They watch parents enter a school.
681	She tugs at her cardigan.
682	He applauds.
683	At the podium, SOMEONE's sailing partner elbows her.
684	Now, in a lobby, SOMEONE adjusts SOMEONE's tie.
685	Now, a lighthouse stands in the golden glow of a low sun.
686	Water ripples in a marina.
687	In town a few pedestrians laze along a sidewalk.
688	SOMEONE waits on the porch of a modest house with a baseball mitt.
689	As SOMEONE comes outside with his own mitt, his brother eyes his watch.
690	The younger brother pounds his glove.
691	He runs down the driveway and up the street.
692	SOMEONE steps out after him.
693	He beckons the boy.
694	SOMEONE takes a step closer and starts to throw.
695	The younger brother lumbers over.
696	SOMEONE takes the ball.
697	As the boy obeys, their mother comes out in scrubs.
698	She runs after a bus.
699	Night time.
700	SOMEONE takes notes as he watches a baseball game on TV.
701	In the kitchen, SOMEONE cooks dinner.
702	He furiously scribbles notes.
703	Now, outside, SOMEONE climbs out a window and pauses on a ledge.
704	He hops down to the Splendid Splinter which sits with its sails lowered, then jumps down to the shadowy driveway.
705	Creeping alongside the house, he makes his way to the family car.
706	He quietly opens the driver's side door and gets behind the wheel.
707	As he starts the engine, the headlights reveal SOMEONE standing in his path.
708	He wears a Red Sox jacket, his mitt,  and a giant foam finger.
709	SOMEONE glares, then begrudgingly beckons his younger brother.
710	He gets into the car beside him.
711	He buckles himself in.
712	SOMEONE starts the car, then lightly backhands him.
713	SOMEONE whacks him playfully.
714	He smacks SOMEONE again.
715	SOMEONE arches his brow.
716	SOMEONE settles irritably into his seat.
717	SOMEONE gets in one last punch.
718	The car slows to a stop as a steady stream of vehicles passes.
719	He turns the wheels to make a turn.
720	Cut to black.
721	Now, shiny sparks glimmer in the darkness.
722	As our view passes over them, they reveal themselves to be thousands of glass shards scattered on the inky asphalt.
723	The station wagon lies on its crushed roof and an ambulance arrives down.
724	he is sitting between his brother's legs.
725	A paramedic's dark clad legs stride toward the car.
726	He shines a flashlight.
727	The paramedic shocks SOMEONE with defibrillator paddles.
728	He puts his hand on his neck.
729	He sees his brother beneath a sheet on another gurney.
730	Back at the scene of the accident.
731	It shows wrecked station wagon.
732	A flashlight sweeps over SOMEONE's baseball cap.
733	SOMEONE cradles SOMEONE's baseball glove against his chest as a white coffin lowers into an open grave.
734	He's swollen and eyes puffy.
735	He stares of numbly.
736	He looks up and catches a glimpse of a red shape behind a headstone.
737	SOMEONE nervously shifts his gaze.
738	His pallid mother blinks down at the casket.
739	SOMEONE backs away.
740	As he shuffles off, his mother grabs his arm.
741	Glancing at SOMEONE's grave over his shoulder, he pulls away, then breaks into a run.
742	He abandons the funeral and sprints into the forest.
743	More headstones stand.
744	SOMEONE races pass them.
745	With his brother's baseball glove, he jogs down a trail.
746	The setting sun flares through the trees around him ramming into the path.
747	He sees the scene of accident.
748	He starts to push himself up, then lowers his head toward the ground.
749	The grieving brother crawls onto his hands and knees, then weakly sits up.
750	His chest heaves as he grimaces tearfully and hangs his head.
751	The baseball rolls back out of the forest toward the mitt.
752	SOMEONE glances at it, then lifts his gaze.
753	His twisted features relax.
754	SOMEONE stands before him in his Red Sox jacket.
755	SOMEONE gawks at his brother, then quizzically knits his brow.
756	SOMEONE gives an irritable shrug.
757	His stunned older brother continues to stare at him.
758	SOMEONE blinks.
759	His lips pressed into a slight pout.
760	SOMEONE earnestly lifts his dark brows.
761	SOMEONE's gaping mouth curls into a faint smile.
762	His brother gives a sharp nod.
763	The ruddy leather mitt and white baseball lie on the mossy ground between them.
764	Our view rises into the trees above then soars into the sky.
765	The forest stretches across rolling hills between streaks of grayish orange clouds.
766	The water catches their reflection in a flame color.
767	Now, dull gray clouds hang over the same view of the forest, the bay, and the sea.
768	We glide toward the coastline and dive through the trees to the grassy cemetery.
769	She awkwardly hikes off.
770	SOMEONE gazes after her.
771	A marine in dress uniform crouches at one of them.
772	SOMEONE strides toward him.
773	The marine picks at something on the stone, then stands and grins.
774	It's SOMEONE.
775	SOMEONE picks at bird poop on top of the stone, then studies it on the finger of his white glove.
776	Elsewhere, SOMEONE carries a crossbow to a tree trunk stump with two arrows.
777	Plopping the weapon on the ground, he quizzically eyes SOMEONE a short distance away.
778	The caretaker stands alone among the headstones, gesturing conversationally and nodding as if talking to someone.
779	SOMEONE keeps his gaze locked on his boss as he uses a pair of pliers to tug a crossbow bolt out of the tree.
780	SOMEONE nods, seemingly to no one.
781	He beams and strolls off toward the forest.
782	SOMEONE watches tearfully.
783	SOMEONE steps out of view behind the headstone which reads Timothy Patrick Sullivan, Lieutenant U. S. Marine Corp.
784	Now, SOMEONE strolls into a hobby and toy shop.
785	Three teen girls stand behind the counter.
786	His uniform work shirt.
787	Wearing a long sleeve T, he tosses down his keys and slides open a drawer.
788	He pulls out a mitt and a white baseball.
789	He pauses at the door to check the Quincy Harbor Sunset chart, then gives it a light tap and exits.
790	It shows he's moving the toy plane aside the gator.
791	Now the setting sun flares brightly through the forest.
792	SOMEONE hikes past a headstone showing a weeping angel trash bags slung over his shoulder while cradling his baseball glove to his chest  smiling.
793	He walks in the sunny forest and enters the glade.
794	He slings down the trash bag, winds up and pitches in the air.
795	It smacks down into SOMEONE's mitt.
796	SOMEONE shows the plane.
797	Big brother pounds his fist into his own mitt.
798	Later, the ball bounces along the ground and SOMEONE catches it.
799	He throws it back.
800	SOMEONE sends him more grounders.
801	SOMEONE's jaw drops.
802	SOMEONE throws the ball toward him, but he lets it bounce past.
803	SOMEONE chuckles and shakes his head.
804	SOMEONE remains solemn.
805	The younger brother swallows.
806	His gaze drifting around the forest.
807	Later, at an inlet.
808	The toy plane taxis on the water.
809	SOMEONE's smile falters and he grows thoughtful.
810	His older brother glances skyward.
811	The toy plane speeds into the sky.
812	It circles, then flies into the birds.
813	Light gives way to evening.
814	SOMEONE flips his hair out of his face.
815	His merry grin fades as he surveys the darkened inlet.
816	Finding himself alone, he idly runs his arms through the water.
817	Later, he climbs back onto shore.
818	His long sleeved T molding itself to his life muscular.
819	The grieving brother heaves a sigh and stares out at the inlet.
820	Now, a light shines outside the boat shed and a window glows from within.
821	Inside, SOMEONE sketches a sloop in red ink at a drafting table.
822	He marks a star burst on the sail.
823	Now, on another day, the glass door of a shop reflects an image of the street.
824	Opening the door with his back, SOMEONE heads outside.
825	The pale man grabs SOMEONE's shoulder.
826	Now, SOMEONE and Ferrente sit in a booth at a coffee shop.
827	SOMEONE notes a hospital bracelet on the wrist of his frail looking companion.
828	He lifts his palm skyward and opens them toward SOMEONE.
829	The young man swallows.
830	Under Ferrente's stare, SOMEONE glances away, then shifts in his seat.
831	Now, he strides out of the restaurant, his eyes cast downward.
832	As he steps into the street, a fisherman in waterproof bib pants passes him carrying a coil of rope slung over his shoulder.
833	Heading toward the harbor, SOMEONE lifts his gaze and stops.
834	He stares mesmerized out at the water.
835	A beautiful state of the art sloop glides across the harbor.
836	SOMEONE looks away sucking in a breath, then returns his gaze to the sailboat.
837	As he sets his bag in the back of his gater, he glances at his watch.
838	At the dock, a television reporter films a news segment.
839	SOMEONE passes the news crew and strides down the pier with his eyes fixed on the boat.
840	Now, the vessel sits anchored with its foresail folded down and tied.
841	The number 11 adorns the side of its sleek hull.
842	SOMEONE squints at SOMEONE as she commands a small crew.
843	In the glade, SOMEONE flips through a boating magazine to an article with photos of SOMEONE.
844	He grabs the magazine and runs off.
845	He reads the article.
846	He holds the open magazine against his leg and smooth's its wrinkled pages.
847	Night time.
848	At the cemetery, a light above the boat shed's open barn door illuminates the bow of SOMEONE's neglected sailboat inside.
849	In his work area, he sketches at a drafting table.
850	The boating magazine rests above his paper open to pictures and diagrams of SOMEONE's canting keel.
851	He leans back in his chair and glances around absentmindedly with his pencil.
852	Later, he rests his head on his hand, his brow furrowed.
853	Lifting his gaze, he strokes his chin thoughtfully and stares at a calendar on the wall.
854	Its monthly picture shows a whale's tail fin curved upward.
855	Now at the docks, our view glides from the blue and red hull of sloop to SOMEONE sketching the sailboat.
856	SOMEONE approaches from behind.
857	He taps SOMEONE's right shoulder, then leans over the left.
858	SOMEONE flinches.
859	SOMEONE stares at him.
860	Elsewhere in the tavern, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE at a table.
861	He shows a weather map.
862	From the dining area, he points SOMEONE through a window.
863	He circles his finger by his temple.
864	She meets his gaze.
865	SOMEONE looks over.
866	He grins at SOMEONE.
867	He punches him in the face.
868	SOMEONE watches him go.
869	Outside, SOMEONE heads on to the dock with his bag.
870	He glances over his shoulder at some people leaving the tavern, then pauses and examines his right hand.
871	As he pulls his jacket tight around himself, his gaze freezes and he stares wistfully out at the water.
872	A lamp at the dock's railing illuminates his lonesome figure.
873	Now, SOMEONE cautiously grabs a suspended safety wire running along the side of SOMEONE's sloop.
874	He slides his hand across it as he walks the length of the deck.
875	The vessel's lowered sails rest loosely around the boom, their folds draped over the cabin's roof.
876	SOMEONE sweeps his gaze up at taut vertical line, then gives it a light karate chop.
877	Grabbing onto it, he jumps up onto the edge of the deck.
878	He leans back and tugs on the line.
879	He remembers holding a line on his own boat.
880	He sees SOMEONE in the cockpit.
881	He starts to leave.
882	She smirks at him as she pulls the crank off a winch.
883	She climbs up onto her deck and looks down at SOMEONE.
884	He averts his gaze and stares off.
885	Shifting her eyes, SOMEONE sucks in a breath, then glances at her shoes.
886	SOMEONE watches as she jumps into the sunken cockpit and grabs the lip of the cabin's roof.
887	She shoots him a look, then swings into the boat.
888	SOMEONE glances away, then buries his face in his hands.
889	Lifting his gaze again, he swallows hard.
890	SOMEONE peers out from the cabin.
891	As she emerges, SOMEONE takes his drawing pad out of his bag.
892	SOMEONE looks down on him from her deck.
893	He shows her his keel sketch.
894	He averts his gaze.
895	Crouching beside him, SOMEONE takes the pad.
896	She flips to his drawing of her sloop.
897	SOMEONE eyes him, her face inches from his.
898	He steps away.
899	She looks off, then glances at SOMEONE as he leaves.
900	Pale sunlight glows on the horizon and shadows hang over the boats at the marina.
901	An aerial view shows sunbeams leaking through evergreens behind the Quincy lighthouse.
902	SOMEONE stares out at the inlet where SOMEONE's sloop glides toward the open sea.
903	The boat tilts slightly.
904	Billowing sails.
905	A name on its stern.
906	SOMEONE uses her radio.
907	She puts down the mic, then eyes her sails.
908	She pushes the tiller, then pulls on a rope.
909	Now, in the glade, SOMEONE, on a baseball, he tosses the ball to SOMEONE.
910	SOMEONE throws back to SOMEONE.
911	SOMEONE fakes a hard throw.
912	SOMEONE mocks him.
913	He throws the ball fast.
914	He holds his glove chest high.
915	As SOMEONE winds up, SOMEONE closes his eyes.
916	SOMEONE pitches the ball into SOMEONE's crotch.
917	As rain pours down on the brothers, a smile spreads across SOMEONE's face.
918	SOMEONE dives onto his lid, but goes nowhere.
919	In the cemetery, darkness falls over the statue of a young girl, then the rain ceases as day breaks.
920	Some geese peck at the grass while SOMEONE peeks out at them from behind a headstone.
921	He rushes at them, banging his trash can lids together.
922	SOMEONE spots her.
923	Colorful flowers line the hedge around the graves.
924	She stands and winces.
925	He jogs back to her.
926	He indicates a wound on her head.
927	Later, SOMEONE applies antiseptic to her wound.
928	He lowers her hair back over the cut.
929	He goes to the kitchen.
930	SOMEONE drums on the edge of her chair, then stands and crosses to a window.
931	She notices a framed photo of SOMEONE and SOMEONE on the Splendid Splinter and picks it up.
932	SOMEONE blinks, his gaze stricken.
933	She leaves the cabin with a coy smirk.
934	Turning, SOMEONE plants his hands on the kitchen door frame and leans far back.
935	He straightens, checks his watch, and checks the sunset chart.
936	Pounding it with his fist, he pulls a curtain aside and watches SOMEONE walk away through a warped glass window.
937	He rushes from the cabin to a waterside ridge.
938	Jumping down to the gravel shore, he races after SOMEONE.
939	He halts in his tracks, gazing helplessly after the departing girl.
940	She slows as he runs to catch up to her.
941	Walking away, SOMEONE bites her lip.
942	She turns back with a warm smirk.
943	SOMEONE throws to his brother.
944	SOMEONE catches the ball, tosses it from his mitt to his hand, then returns it.
945	The young boy lowers his doleful gaze.
946	SOMEONE gives a nod and readies himself for a catch.
947	SOMEONE pounds the ball into his glove, then throws it to him.
948	At dinner.
949	SOMEONE goes into the kitchen.
950	Clad in a white halter dress, SOMEONE crosses to a bulletin board covered in sketches of boat designs.
951	She turns abruptly as SOMEONE returns with a glass of white wine for her.
952	She takes it and points.
953	Stacked boxes fill a corner of the room.
954	SOMEONE lowers her gaze.
955	Pointing, SOMEONE crosses to a high box.
956	His gaze distant, the young man sips his wine.
957	SOMEONE points over her shoulder where SOMEONE's sketch of her sloop hangs on the wall.
958	He looks from the drawing to his date.
959	She leans back coyly against his drafting table and sips her wine.
960	He steps in close, reaches past her shoulder and takes the sketch down.
961	With a smoldering look, he offers it to her.
962	She takes it with a coquettish smirk.
963	As he leans in closer, she brushes past him.
964	She faces a map.
965	SOMEONE steps in behind her.
966	He plants a tender kiss on her shoulder.
967	He turns her to face him and his lips hungrily finds hers.
968	She briefly melts into the kiss, then stops him gently.
969	SOMEONE reluctantly backs off and she heads for the door.
970	He plants his hands on the dining table and bends over, leaning his hips back.
971	He turns, then crosses to the door and opens it.
972	Finding no one there, he hurries back to the table.
973	He grabs a jar containing a burning candle, then ventures out into the darkness.
974	He shuts the door behind him and looks around.
975	He proceeds against pale mist.
976	He turns around.
977	Tall stone monuments in the searching spot.
978	He catches a glimpse of SOMEONE and proceeds in her direction.
979	He continues searching.
980	He turns, she plants a passionate kiss on his lips.
981	He pulls her close as they tenderly canoodle.
982	They kiss.
983	But SOMEONE pulls back.
984	She blows out the candle and runs off.
985	To a stop, with the angel monument silhouetted behind the head.
986	SOMEONE waits for him in a clearing between grave plots.
987	She lays her hands on his chest.
988	SOMEONE slowly rolls his shoulders back.
989	Moving as one, they turn on the spot.
990	Sharing a tender gaze, SOMEONE trails her fingers scars on SOMEONE's upper chest and gives a gentle smile.
991	SOMEONE's expression darkens and he turns his gaze skyward.
992	Smiling, she gives him a gentle peck on the lips.
993	SOMEONE pulls her into a long kiss.
994	SOMEONE lays her head on his shoulder.
995	Deeper into the embrace.
996	The next morning, SOMEONE sleeps naked amid the grave monuments.
997	His head rolls toward us and his eyes blink open groggily.
998	He smacks his dry lips.
999	A lone goose stares back at him.
1000	Now, in jeans and a T-shirt, SOMEONE hikes up the waterside path leading to the caretaker's grounds.
1001	He breaks into a brief jog, rubbing his eyes.
1002	Reaching the cabin, he finds a slip of paper tacked to the door bearing a doodle of the Splendid Splinter.
1003	A handwritten note on the back reads come find me.
1004	Turning the slip over, SOMEONE reads the message and smiles.
1005	He jogs toward the boat shed which sits with its barn doors closed.
1006	Turning to the bay, he finds SOMEONE manning his old skiff.
1007	SOMEONE glances away pensively.
1008	Clad in her buttoned down shirt, SOMEONE smiles at him.
1009	In the boat, SOMEONE trails his fingers in the water.
1010	Now, in the golden glow of a low sun, SOMEONE and SOMEONE cuddle at the top of a lighthouse.
1011	SOMEONE nods.
1012	SOMEONE faces the water with a smile.
1013	She eyes him quizzically, her smile gradually fading.
1014	He leaves SOMEONE alone at the lighthouse.
1015	Now, SOMEONE sprints frantically through the woods following the winding footpath.
1016	He reaches the glade.
1017	He finds his brother trudging away.
1018	He halts at the edge of the woods and turns back.
1019	Turning, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE behind him.
1020	He looks back in SOMEONE's direction.
1021	He finds his brother gone.
1022	SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
1023	SOMEONE takes his hand and kisses it.
1024	He shakes his head, then yanks his hand from her grasp.
1025	SOMEONE blinks tearfully as she watches him turn away.
1026	With a resolute expression, he steps further into the glade.
1027	He shuts his eyes.
1028	As SOMEONE leaves, he opens them again in a haunted stare.
1029	We peer back at him from the edge of the woods as he stands motionless, his gaze fixed in our direction.
1030	Night time.
1031	In the caretaker's cabin, SOMEONE sits alone and bleary eyed with a glass of whiskey.
1032	SOMEONE morosely sips his liquor.
1033	The next morning, boats languidly sail past the coastal town.
1034	In a house overlooking a bay, a golden retriever gnaws on a chew toy in the living room.
1035	SOMEONE pulls on a denim jacket.
1036	SOMEONE eyes the dog, grabs a leash from a hook by the door.
1037	Dog runs out a doggie door.
1038	SOMEONE leaves the house.
1039	Meanwhile, SOMEONE lies asleep on his couch.
1040	He licks his lips, then groggily lifts his head.
1041	He rises.
1042	He sets a coffee pot in the kitchen sink.
1043	As water fills the carafe, he opens a freezer and takes out a rumpled bag of grounds.
1044	He scowls at it, then gives it a shake.
1045	He crumples it.
1046	He tosses it over his shoulder and shuts off the tap.
1047	Now, at a diner counter, SOMEONE sips coffee.
1048	SOMEONE joins him.
1049	Wearing green sweater, he browses a newspaper.
1050	Two officers step to a prominent spot in the dinning room.
1051	Outside, she runs.
1052	SOMEONE lets the dog run by.
1053	SOMEONE's smile fades as her friend walks past her with no acknowledgement.
1054	SOMEONE faces a shop window.
1055	Back in the diner.
1056	SOMEONE frowns at the window.
1057	SOMEONE pictures the Carniceria and the brewing squall.
1058	A view from his cottage shows SOMEONE vanish as she walks away.
1059	SOMEONE passes by.
1060	The Splendid Splinter remains stored inside.
1061	SOMEONE stares at the neglected boat.
1062	Now, in the cemetery, tombstones stand in light and shadow.
1063	A distant sprinkler waters the grass.
1064	SOMEONE glowers as he strides among the graves.
1065	SOMEONE steps into view and crouches down on one knee.
1066	Farther along, our view peers over the headstone in memory of SOMEONE's father.
1067	The engraved side remains hidden to us, but visible to him.
1068	SOMEONE leans huddled against her father's headstone.
1069	SOMEONE's tearful gaze stays on her as she returns a grief stricken look.
1070	Her head wound bleeds.
1071	SOMEONE's eyes pool with tears.
1072	His jaw falls slack.
1073	He sheds a heavy tear, then blinks his stunned red eyes.
1074	He's alone in the hedge lined plot.
1075	SOMEONE bows his head restlessly, then looks up, his face locked in a stiff SOMEONE.
1076	He throws papers and books off his desk.
1077	He hunches the sunset chart on the wall.
1078	Down onto a table SOMEONE doubles over the charts, agonizing.
1079	He grips the table and presses his forehead to the fallen charts.
1080	He straightens a little, his eyes on the charts.
1081	Clad in a deep blue shirt, his strong back flexes as he catches his breath.
1082	SOMEONE opens a bureau drawer.
1083	Reaching inside, he strokes his baseball mitt, then firmly lays it flat.
1084	He leans over the open drawer, his eyes un-waveringly on its contents.
1085	Our view of SOMEONE seen from the shoulders up straightens with him and he leaves the cottage.
1086	Now, SOMEONE sits in the woods, his gaze distant.
1087	SOMEONE looks on.
1088	His red mitt dangles on his hand at his side.
1089	SOMEONE takes a few steps closer and lets his mitt drop to the ground.
1090	He takes a seat by his big brother.
1091	SOMEONE peers sidelong at his brother who stares off.
1092	SOMEONE rests a hand on SOMEONE's leg.
1093	SOMEONE sits frozen in a troubled daze.
1094	Now, at night, his cottage door opens and he turns on the lights.
1095	Later, in the ransacked room, he positions a milk crate on the messy floor.
1096	He dumps some papers into it in a feeble start to cleaning up.
1097	Outside, a woman in a dark knee length dress treads toward the cottage door.
1098	The fair skinned brunette woman reaches out offering the necklace.
1099	SOMEONE reaches out and accepts.
1100	As the widow turns away, SOMEONE fingers the medallion.
1101	SOMEONE smiles sadly as she leaves alone and SOMEONE regards the silver quatrefoil pendant.
1102	His gaze focuses beyond the medallion to the floor where SOMEONE's note in red ink shows among the cluttered papers.
1103	The doodle of the sailboat lies face up.
1104	SOMEONE fetches the note.
1105	He meditatively takes a seat and turns the scrap over reading the three word message in SOMEONE's cute handwriting - come find me.
1106	SOMEONE backs SOMEONE away.
1107	SOMEONE watches SOMEONE enter the convenience type store to finish his transaction, then he faces SOMEONE.
1108	The cruise get closer.
1109	Now, in the full featuring a half dozen rocky humps.
1110	Now, it shows the reflection of sun on the sea.
1111	SOMEONE groggily to his feet.
1112	SOMEONE reluctantly stands.
1113	Outside sky leaving only patches of powder blue.
1114	SOMEONE checks his watch.
1115	SOMEONE glances at his friend.
1116	His bold gaze drift.
1117	His friend lies down.
1118	SOMEONE keeps his eyes shut and arms crossed.
1119	SOMEONE stares off tearful gently ruffled by the wind.
1120	He holds up the St. Jude medallion and gazes at its polished necklace.
1121	It glints in the brilliant.
1122	He stares at the necklace with a knit brow, then squeezes his fist and turns his resolute glare toward the water.
1123	The setting sun color.
1124	In Quincy, the dock lights turn on and the sunset cannon fires.
1125	In the cemetery, shadows stretch over the grass.
1126	An old headstone shaped like a Celtic cross towers over the other grave markers.
1127	Five geese wander past.
1128	In the glade, golden beams of light shine on SOMEONE.
1129	The boy is waiting.
1130	The boy stares expectantly at the other end of the clearing, then shakes his hair out of his eyes.
1131	He gives a slight wince.
1132	His lips pout into a frown.
1133	On the boat, golden light bathes SOMEONE's solemn face.
1134	In the glade, SOMEONE drops his gaze.
1135	He puts his baseball cap on, then wipes his nose on the back of his hand.
1136	Gazing skyward, he adjusts the hat lower on his forehead.
1137	Several teardrops plummet down his cheeks.
1138	In the glade, SOMEONE sadly bows his head.
1139	Mustering a brave expression, he punches a fist into his mitt.
1140	He glances at the sky, then hikes off into the forest and looks back over his shoulder at waning golden light filling the glade.
1141	A smile breaks across his boyish face.
1142	Big brother playfully swats his cheek.
1143	Back in the forest, the setting sun brightens and SOMEONE's grinning form vanishes.
1144	Back at sea, gray clouds darken the orange tinted sky.
1145	SOMEONE looks up and finds a shooting across it.
1146	His lips part.
1147	As the sun sinks below the horizon, the shooting star falls to the horizon.
1148	He returns toward the cabin and bangs on the windshield in front of SOMEONE.
1149	The search on a flashlight.
1150	Meanwhile SOMEONE radios in.
1151	Flashlight moves under the rippling water.
1152	SOMEONE dives back under the water.
1153	His flashlight focuses on a flotation vest.
1154	SOMEONE scrambles.
1155	Finding it empty, he angrily shoves it aside.
1156	His flashlight scans around the flooded surroundings.
1157	He then lowers it and dives back under the surface.
1158	The light finds an open portal.
1159	But rubbery raft like debris ripples on the sea floor.
1160	He struggles to work his right arm.
1161	He stumbles onward, gripping a piece of drift.
1162	He continues heavily on the lawn.
1163	He makes his way on the beach of a nearby cove door.
1164	In a crevice between the rocks, he sees a body.
1165	SOMEONE's teeth chatter as he treads forward.
1166	He weakly crawls up to the figure and sees that it's SOMEONE.
1167	SOMEONE hovers over her for a moment, then lies down beside her and feels her pulse.
1168	HE pushes her jacket open.
1169	He parts the bib of her wader shirt beneath it.
1170	He tries to open shirt beneath it.
1171	Exposing her bare stomach and black sports bra.
1172	Working from inside her jacket, he pulls her limp body toward his and cradles her head in the crook of his other arm.
1173	As he holds her tightly, the picture fades to black.
1174	SOMEONE panting as he continues to embrace SOMEONE.
1175	He presses his lips to her forehead, breathing heavily against her.
1176	Now, the two sleep, a breeze ruffles Tess's hair and jacket and a brilliant light shines down on them.
1177	He wakes up.
1178	He groggily awakens.
1179	He flinging it off.
1180	He tearfully knits his brow.
1181	His chin quavers and he heaves a relieved sigh.
1182	Three butterflies cover a laceration on his temple.
1183	He blinks, then gives a faint wince and furrows his brow.
1184	He swallows repeatedly, grabs a cup from a nearby table and downs its contents.
1185	He pours some water from a pitcher and hands it over.
1186	SOMEONE nods and offers his friend a smile.
1187	Grinning to himself, Charlie settles back on his pillows.
1188	Now, a two-story home surrounded by greenery stands on a low rise overlooking the water.
1189	On the porch, SOMEONE sits solemnly in a wicker chair with Bobo lying on the ground beside her.
1190	Gazing out at the bay, she stands and steps forward.
1191	SOMEONE's boat sails toward her.
1192	SOMEONE watches it with an intense stare.
1193	Later, she treads down a long dock jutting into the water.
1194	SOMEONE grins at her from atop the cabin of his boat.
1195	She smiles and bashfully bites her lower lip.
1196	Now, she helps him tie his boat to the dock.
1197	He averts his gaze.
1198	SOMEONE pats the boat's deck.
1199	He stares after her as she walks away.
1200	With a shocked look, SOMEONE stops and turns back to him.
1201	She shakes her head, her lips parted.
1202	SOMEONE strolls over, his eyes fixed on her perplexed face.
1203	She blinks at him as he holds her gaze.
1204	Glancing down, she bites her lower lip, then tightens her mouth into a thoughtful line.
1205	A faint smile appears.
1206	SOMEONE jerks his head.
1207	Grinning, he holds out his hand.
1208	Sunlight shines on his upturned palm as SOMEONE places her hand in his.
1209	Now, light shines through the windows into the empty cabin.
1210	He glances at his watch.
1211	He walks slowly and stop.
1212	Squinting in the light, he clenches his jaw.
1213	Later, SOMEONE strolls into the glade.
1214	His arms hang loosely at his sides as he scans his eyes over the clearing.
1215	He stares sadly at the place where Sam used to wait for him.
1216	SOMEONE appears behind him.
1217	SOMEONE turns slightly, still unable to see his brother.
1218	SOMEONE stares into the trees, his brow creased and the corners of his mouth turn down slightly.
1219	He squats, resting his arms on is bent legs.

1221	SOMEONE rises.
1222	He shifts his eyes over SOMEONE's spot during their games of catch, then turns away and starts to trudge out of the glade.
1223	He abruptly turns back to the empty clearing.
1224	His gaze over.
1225	Then sunlight seeps through the trees as SOMEONE goes on his way.
1226	She stands waiting for SOMEONE.
1227	Downstairs, SOMEONE chats with a guest.

1243	SOMEONE eyes one of them.
1244	He tucks it into his breast pocket.
1245	Shaking his head he strides to the door and points at SOMEONE.

1247	As he moves past two chatting guests, one of them stops him.
1248	He breezes through the parlor.

1384	In the parlor the brothers struggle unsuccessfully to hold the dwarf and open the coffin at the same time.

1410	SOMEONE's crotch presses against SOMEONE's cheek.
1411	He holds SOMEONE right underneath his buttocks.
1412	She watches him slip out of view into the house, then collapses tiredly.
1413	In the parlor the guests reconvene.
1414	She eyes him as she sniffs.
1415	She hurries off.
1416	With a smirk, SOMEONE nods at his mother.

1443	He glances at SOMEONE who nods reassuringly.
1444	With wide eyes he reads.
1445	SOMEONE turns his quizzical gaze to the coffin behind him.
1446	SOMEONE frowns and SOMEONE shifts uneasily.
1447	The coffin shakes.
1448	It opens and SOMEONE sits up.
1449	SOMEONE leans on the coffin's rim and glares out at the room.
1450	SOMEONE claps.

1467	He rests his hand on Uncle SOMEONE's shoulder as he passes by.
1468	He pounds SOMEONE's fist and squeezes his mother's hand.
1469	Smiling SOMEONE sits up and watches SOMEONE exit.
1470	SOMEONE pushes him back down.
1471	Uncle SOMEONE eyes the photo from the Dreamgirls premier.
1472	He shakes his head pensively.
1473	Now, SOMEONE strolls downstairs with a suitcase in each hand and sets them by a table in the foyer.
1474	SOMEONE looks over from the parlor.
1475	He sits beside SOMEONE.
1476	SOMEONE opens the front door and finds Martina waiting outside in a red sports car.

1481	SOMEONE bites his lip excitedly as he saunters to Martina's car.
1482	SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from the doorway.
1483	SOMEONE pauses.
1484	Turning, he grins at the couple then gives them a shrug.
1485	As he hurries to the car Martina smiles.
1486	Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lounge on a couch.
1487	She whispers into his ear.
1488	They kiss.
1489	Grinning, SOMEONE returns his wife's kisses, then pulls away.
1490	On the roof.
1491	Uncle SOMEONE sits naked above the bathroom window.
1492	They pause at the edge of the clearing.
1493	where they behold an amazing house made of candy and pastries.
1494	The children cautiously walk through the compound up to the house, looking around as they go.
1495	They stop and exchange a glance before they charge to the door and pound on it.
1496	the boy breaks off a piece of the house and starts to eat it.
1497	The girl picks off a piece near her and tastes it as well.
1498	As the siblings chew, the door to the cottage creaks open.
1499	With an unnerved look at each other, the duo enters the house hesitantly.
1500	and the door slowly closes behind them.
1501	Inside, flames light on candles around the room.
1502	The kids grab hold of one another.
1503	as they suddenly see the twisted silhouette of a figure watching them.
1504	The siblings clutch each other in fright.
1505	as a disfigured witch with rotted teeth walks into the light.
1506	eyeing them with an evil smirk.
1507	Later, the young boy is imprisoned in a cage.
1508	while his shackled sister looks on.
1509	The witch strikes her and she falls.
1510	The witch attempts to force feed the boy.
1511	The girl pulls out a loose nail.
1512	and pockets it as the witch grabs her and holds a knife to her throat.
1513	Her brother reluctantly eats.
1514	A fire blazes in an oven.
1515	The witch slams her knife into a stool.
1516	and moves to the cage, grabbing the boy.
1517	As she and the boy struggle, the girl picks the lock on her chain with the nail until it pops open.
1518	The witch then opens the oven door.
1519	The girl runs to the stool and picks up the knife.
1520	The witch slowly turns around to her.
1521	and fires a bolt from her wand.
1522	It shoots right through the girl doing no harm.
1523	The girl stabs her repeatedly with the knife.
1524	As the hut collapses, the girl frees her brother.
1525	Behind them, the witch slowly gets to her feet spitting blood.
1526	The boy strikes the witch with the log causing her to fall back into the oven.
1527	The siblings yank on a chain that closes the furnace as they watch her burn.
1528	Over a gust of flames.
1529	An etching of a town surrounded by mountains.
1530	A lost child poster burns in a dark forest.
1531	A drawing of a monster chasing three children.
1532	under the headline, "Child Saved by Hansel and Gretel".

1536	A silhouette standing in the flames shoots a burning arrow past some towns people.
1537	Another headline: Meadow witch killed.
1538	'Heroes, Hansel and Gretel, swamp witch dead' over a picture of two young adults spearing a prostrate witch.
1539	The numerous dark outlines of trees have missing children posters attached to them.
1540	From out of nowhere, an arrow pins a sheet of paper to a tree.
1541	The poster is consumed by flames.
1542	a man unloads jugs of milk featuring a drawing of a young boy's face on them.
1543	A teenage boy grabs one and runs towards a gathering of townspeople.
1544	He immerses the captive woman's head in a barrel of water.
1545	The woman struggles with her captors.
1546	as a man in his 50s approaches.
1547	He turns to the crowd.
1548	A gun appears at pointblank range near SOMEONE's head.
1549	They disperse as SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE, a young woman with light hair.
1550	SOMEONE headbutts the Sheriff.
1551	His deputies grab their guns but SOMEONE aims at them first.
1552	SOMEONE lowers his gun.
1553	On the ground, SOMEONE grasps his bloody nose.
1554	SOMEONE, a young woman with dark hair and an athletic build, kicks down the door of an isolated cottage in the woods.
1555	She points her crossbow at a witch with scaly skin and black hair who turns.
1556	and raises her hands to her head.
1557	The hag throws a dagger at SOMEONE.
1558	who catches it with the end of her crossbow.
1559	and shoots at the witch.
1560	The witch dodges the bolts.
1561	grabs her broom and flies through a window, breaking some wooden panes as she bursts through.
1562	As she soars through the forest.
1563	she is shot and is sent crashing to the ground.
1564	SOMEONE, a young muscular man with dark hair, stands nearby with his gun on his shoulder.
1565	his foot resting on the witch's broomstick.
1566	As the witch scurries away.
1567	he shoots then runs after her in pursuit.
1568	The witch grabs her wand and fires at him.
1569	but the dark energy bounces off him.
1570	She then casts a spell and barrier of tall, thin trees raises in front of him.
1571	SOMEONE weakens the barrier by shooting at it and then runs through.
1572	Nearby, SOMEONE listens to the sounds of battle.
1573	The witch continues on her flight, a demon-like quality giving her speed and agility through the obstacles of the forest.
1574	as SOMEONE pursues closely behind.
1575	As the witch pulls ahead, SOMEONE flies out of the underbrush and tackles her to the ground.
1576	SOMEONE catches up with the witch and the two of them exchange blows.
1577	SOMEONE strikes the witch.
1578	SOMEONE is blinded as the hag throws dirt in his eyes.

1580	The witch gets up and turns to flee.
1581	SOMEONE somersaults, grabs her crossbow and shoots the witch in the ankle.
1582	She heaves the weapon over a branch and pulls on a string attached to the arrow.
1583	Dragging the witch until she hangs suspended in the air by her foot.
1584	SOMEONE snatches the witches wand away from her.
1585	The witch flails in mid-air as the siblings watch.
1586	He strikes her with his gun.
1587	SOMEONE unrolls a scroll.
1588	SOMEONE checks his wrist-timer.
1589	He injects a substance into his thigh.
1590	Later, a man fills a water bowl for two dogs.
1591	Inside, He throws the boot on the table.
1592	The Sheriff sits facing a few burly men.
1593	SOMEONE throws a pouch down in front of the men.
1594	Coins spill out catching the mercenaries attention.
1595	Outside, a large man with long, blonde hair takes the dogs and leads the men out of town.
1596	SOMEONE watches then saunters off smoking a pipe.
1597	Deep in the dark forest, an unbroken swathe of trees stretches to the horizon.
1598	A fire is lit in a small clearing.
1599	The light casts eerily shadows into the gloom as the nervous trackers huddle around the meager flames.
1600	One of the men picks up a bone and casts it to the dogs.
1601	The men turn to the ignored bone and notice that the dogs are missing.
1602	They look up to see a beautiful woman with long, dark hair.
1603	standing at the edge of the firelight, flanked by the two dogs.
1604	The slowly get up and approach the stranger.
1605	The woman morphs into a witch and the dogs attack their owner.
1606	They scatter.
1607	She casts a spell causing vines to ensnare and suspend a tracker in midair.
1608	Stretching his limbs out in all four directions.
1609	With a sweep of her wand, the man's limbs are torn from his core and drop to the ground with a thud.
1610	The witch then intercepts the remaining hunter.
1611	She touches his forehead.
1612	and, suddenly, creepy crawlers begin to slither around under his skin.
1613	The hunter's eyes roll slightly.
1614	as he starts to dig into the mulch.
1615	and devour the insects within.
1616	The witch watches and snickers.
1617	Later, SOMEONE, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in a pub.
1618	The survivor from the forest staggers into the pub.
1619	He stumbles toward the center of the pub.
1620	The tracker starts to gag and retch.
1621	SOMEONE moves SOMEONE in front of him as a shield.
1622	The man explodes from his stomach sending gore flying in all directions.
1623	Maggots lie among the remains of the tracker.
1624	SOMEONE wipes away from some debris.
1625	In the dark forest, amid the dense tangle of narrow trees.
1626	a tree root snakes across the ground.
1627	and buries deep into the earth to the witches lair.
1628	It branches out to form cages, which imprison missing children.
1629	They cower in their cells as a monstrous troll passes by throwing food from a bucket into their prisons.
1630	The troll throws the bucket aside.
1631	and stomps into a dining room.
1632	where the dark haired witch places two bowls in front of her cohorts.
1633	who take them and drink eagerly.
1634	One of the witches, who has short spiky hair, sets her bowl down.
1635	and raises her hands in wonder.
1636	The head witch grabs her hand and pushes it down into a nearby flame.
1637	The third witch grins.
1638	She cradles her singed hand.
1639	The town is silent under the night sky.
1640	Nothing stirs and only a few flickering lamps release the darkness.
1641	SOMEONE sleeps deeply, her hands folded beneath her head.
1642	She dreams of her mother the night that the siblings were taken into the forest.
1643	and of the father leading them deeper into the woods.
1644	She wakes up and looks down at her brother who is sleeping on the floor.
1645	He rolls over dismissively.
1646	SOMEONE pauses a moment.
1647	then gets out of the bed and walks to the window in her nightdress.
1648	She looks out, her hand resting near the celestial map of the bloodmoon.
1649	In the morning.
1650	SOMEONE's buying clothes at a local shop.
1651	He rolls up the boy's garment as SOMEONE approaches him from behind.
1652	He walks away.
1653	SOMEONE pauses.
1654	He checks his wrist-timer.
1655	He hands a pumpkin.
1656	and lowers himself carefully onto a stoop.
1657	He removes a syringe from his bag.
1658	SOMEONE injects himself.
1659	He repacks his syringe.
1660	and gets up, smiling a little awkwardly at SOMEONE.
1661	SOMEONE watches SOMEONE leave.
1662	In the forest, the spiky haired witch examines some frogs clambering in the moss on a tree.
1663	She picks one up.
1664	She approaches the figure of a boy sitting on a fallen tree trunk.
1665	The pumpkin falls from under a wig.
1666	She looks, confused, at a gramophone.
1667	She picks up the record.
1668	SOMEONE and SOMEONE attack the witch.
1669	SOMEONE appears from the underbrush.
1670	SOMEONE advances cautiously.
1671	The witch suddenly moves.
1672	disarming SOMEONE.
1673	and aiming her crossbow at SOMEONE.
1674	He swiftly bends backwards, just missing the path of the bolt.
1675	SOMEONE jumps on top of the hag.
1676	and tries to reach her wand.
1677	but gets thrown off onto SOMEONE.
1678	SOMEONE charges the witch, but she easily fells him.
1679	and starts to make her escape.
1680	SOMEONE and SOMEONE both follow in hot pursuit.
1681	She grabs her broom and takes flight.
1682	SOMEONE charges ahead and knocks her off mid-air.
1683	using his gun like a baseball bat.
1684	SOMEONE runs up behind the witch and a battle ensues.
1685	When SOMEONE tries to grab his fallen weapon.
1686	the witch uses the prongs on the end of her broom to sweep it out of his reach.
1687	The witch gains the upper hand, knocking down both SOMEONE and SOMEONE.
1688	She once again mounts her brom and soars through the forest.
1689	SOMEONE throws out a grappling hook and snags her broom.
1690	He attaches her to his belt and is dragged across the ground behind the fleeing hag.
1691	SOMEONE anchors his feet against two trees.
1692	causing the broom to pull out from under the witch.
1693	She hits a tree and crumples to the ground.
1694	SOMEONE and SOMEONE advance as the witch gets to her feet.
1695	Just as she raises her hand to cast a spell.
1696	SOMEONE jumps out from behind and electrocutes her.
1697	Back in town.
1698	SOMEONE watches the Mayor leave.
1699	and then looks up at the cell.
1700	where the spiky haired witch is being interrogated by SOMEONE and SOMEONE.
1701	SOMEONE dons a set of brass knuckles.
1702	Blood gurgles from the witches mouth.
1703	SOMEONE rummages through the missing children's files.
1704	SOMEONE rushes out of the room.
1705	High above the town.
1706	SOMEONE and her other witch, one with red hair, hover menacingly.
1707	surveying the town and its sleeping inhabitants.
1708	The red-haired witch swoops down.
1709	SOMEONE sparks a ball of fire and holds it in her palm.
1710	SOMEONE takes aim and casts the fireball towards the town.
1711	Little SOMEONE sleeps peacefully in her bed.
1712	Outside the bedroom, her older brother and mother keep watch nervously.
1713	In town, people urgently try to douse the blaze of SOMEONE's fireball.
1714	The door explodes open.
1715	and the red-haired witch stalks into the house.
1716	She hexes the rifle he is holding and forces him to point it towards his mother.
1717	She is blown out of the window.
1718	SOMEONE is thrown in a cage.
1719	The troll closes the cage and lifts it on his back.
1720	SOMEONE locks the spiky-haired witch in a cell.
1721	The door shatters.
1722	and SOMEONE, as a woman, saunters through the debris.
1723	as SOMEONE, standing on the balcony, aims her crossbow at her.
1724	SOMEONE picks up a missing child's poster.
1725	With a wicked smile, SOMEONE morphs into a witch.
1726	SOMEONE opens fire.
1727	as SOMEONE charges at the stairs.

1729	and throws him.
1730	shattering the bannister as he falls.
1731	SOMEONE pulls out a knife and swings.
1732	but SOMEONE disarms her and grabs her by the throat.
1733	The retreating troll turns to look at SOMEONE.
1734	just as the red-haired witch tackles him to the ground.
1735	They exchange blows.
1736	SOMEONE grabs a milk bottle and uses it to bludgeon the hag.
1737	who then hexes a box and hurls it at SOMEONE.
1738	The crone then grabs her broom and starts to take off.
1739	SOMEONE takes a running jump and catches hold of the broom as the witch flees town.
1740	He slams through part of a roof, which shatters, while he is still clinging to the broom.
1741	In the Sheriff's office.
1742	SOMEONE struggles to his feet.

1749	SOMEONE looks on, whimpering.
1750	The gun rests under SOMEONE's chin.
1751	SOMEONE uses a wheelbarrow to transport SOMEONE, injured and unconscious, through the streets.
1752	Inside, SOMEONE frees the horned witch.
1753	and then looks for SOMEONE.
1754	It's morning.
1755	and SOMEONE lies sleeping peacefully.
1756	as a hand with a damp clothe wipes her face.
1757	SOMEONE moistens the cloth and starts to clean her neck.
1758	He looks around for a moment.
1759	and then proceeds to clean her chest, which rises and falls slowly.
1760	Just as he is about to approach her cleavage with the clothe, she grabs his hand.
1761	She glares at him.
1762	SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a sceptical glance before releasing his hand.
1763	She looks around her and out of the window.
1764	SOMEONE notices a drawing of herself on the wall.
1765	SOMEONE looks at her sheepishly.
1766	SOMEONE looks down as SOMEONE turns to the wall.
1767	At the dining table, SOMEONE reads SOMEONE scrapbook of newspaper clippings.
1768	SOMEONE sets the bowl down and pulls a chair forward.
1769	SOMEONE turns a page and stops to stare at an etching of a woman.

1771	SOMEONE leans froward.
1772	SOMEONE has flashbacks of her mother.
1773	SOMEONE dangles from a tree, unconscious.

1775	She points to her right.
1776	He falls to the ground.
1777	SOMEONE tramps through another part of the woods.
1778	Twisted roots lie among the towering trees.
1779	SOMEONE cleans SOMEONE's wounds by a body of water situated in a gully.
1780	She dampens the clothe again.
1781	and dabs at his neck with the clothe.
1782	SOMEONE looks at the pool with uncertainty, then back at SOMEONE.
1783	She stands up and starts to disrobe.
1784	SOMEONE gets up and turns his back to her.
1785	SOMEONE, now naked, delicately steps into the pool, her skin glowing.
1786	SOMEONE steals a glance and is transfixed.
1787	SOMEONE smiles at him as he enters the water.
1788	She moves towards SOMEONE.
1789	She kisses him.
1790	They embrace passionately.
1791	SOMEONE continues walking through the woods, looking around.
1792	Nearby, the troll looks up from his meal of wild boar.
1793	SOMEONE stops near a fallen tree.
1794	She notices movement in the distance and cautiously investigates, her crossbow at the ready.
1795	She takes aim and moves silently towards the figure hidden by the branches.
1796	As she draws closer, she pushes the tree limbs aside.
1797	and sees one of the sheriff's deputies standing by the tree.
1798	A man assaults her, forcing her into a clearing.
1799	SOMEONE fights back.
1800	Three deputies restrain her by holding her arms and hair.
1801	The Sheriff approaches.
1802	SOMEONE lunges forward and bites the tip of SOMEONE's nose off.
1803	then pulls back and spits the piece in his face.
1804	He approaches her with a bloody face, his teeth clenched in fury and pain, and strikes SOMEONE.
1805	The troll watches from the trees as she falls to the ground.
1806	The Sheriff kicks her in the stomach.
1807	The troll crashes through the tree.
1808	The giant grabs a tree trunk.
1809	and wields it like a club, smashing two of the deputies.
1810	He clubs another man in the head.
1811	The last deputy tries shooting the troll.
1812	Unfazed by the bullets, he crushes the last deputy's head.
1813	The troll then walks up to SOMEONE, who has fallen on the ground.
1814	The troll stomps on his head, his brains and blood splattering on the ground.
1815	SOMEONE's vision of the monster starts to blur as she passes out.
1816	SOMEONE awakens to the gentle rocking motion of being carried.
1817	She looks behind her to see and unfamiliar path in the woods.
1818	She turns her head to find the side of the troll's head.
1819	SOMEONE closes her eyes and leans her head to rest against the giant's shoulder.
1820	They continue down the path, disappearing into the forest.
1821	Back at the gully.
1822	SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE.
1823	The troll settles SOMEONE down by a waterfall.

2206	Now in her bathroom, SOMEONE grabs her electric toothbrush.
2207	The mirror is covered in inspirational quotes written on sticky notes.
2208	including, Obstacles are what you see when you lose sight of your goal.
2209	Blinking rapidly, SOMEONE starts to brush her teeth.
2210	As her gaze scans the brightly colored notes.
2211	she stops brushing and closes her lips around her toothbrush.
2212	With sad eyes, she resumes brushing.
2213	She closes her eyes and tears slide down her cheeks.
2214	As her face crumples, she lowers her toothbrush from her mouth.

2216	A froth of toothpaste clinging to her lower lip.
2217	She reads two quotes;.

2249	SOMEONE sneaks glances at her as he chews.
2250	His date shifts her worried gaze, occasionally eyeing him impassively.
2251	Her features contorting in a pensive frown.
2252	SOMEONE stops eating and leans back in her seat.
2253	Her lips part and her stubborn chin juts forward.
2254	SOMEONE studies her intently.
2255	His brow lifts and he stops chewing.
2256	Catching him staring, SOMEONE gives a nervous half-smile and looks down.
2257	SOMEONE's lips curl into a dreamy-eyed smile.
2258	He opens the restaurant door for SOMEONE and follows her out with a goofy grin.
2259	He shrugs and beams at her.
2260	SOMEONE creases her lips, sizing him up.
2261	SOMEONE watches her go with his boyish grin.
2262	Now SOMEONE uses his cellphone as he leaves his building.
2263	In a bar, SOMEONE talks on the phone.
2264	SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, the doorman.
2265	The doorman chuckles, points, and steps away.
2266	Now SOMEONE plods up a flight of stairs.
2267	Entering her apartment.
2268	she finds a bouquet of flowers with an attached construction paper card, reading, We love you, Smalls.
2269	Dozens of other notes surround the gift, and SOMEONE sits behind the display.
2270	Now in SOMEONE's apartment.
2271	He crosses to the door.
2272	SOMEONE sulks into the living room.
2273	She halts abruptly and looks around.
2274	He leads her to a couch.
2275	As she sits, he lies down and puts his head in her lap.
2276	SOMEONE squirms an arm out from under his shoulder and sets her bag on the floor.
2277	Daytime.
2278	SOMEONE ushers SOMEONE through a dignified office building's thriving lobby.
2279	Reaching a reception desk, they peer at a vast wall mounted directory.
2280	SOMEONE brushes off his son's suit jacket as he guides him along.
2281	Now they sit side-by-side on a waiting room couch.
2282	both resting their hands on their parted knees and drumming their fingers.
2283	Later, SOMEONE faces a bearded man.
2284	SOMEONE's head droops forward and he bites his upper lip.
2285	Now SOMEONE arrives in a tasteful office where a man with a closely trimmed beard waits at a desk.
2286	He gestures to a SOMEONE to sit on chair or ottoman.
2287	SOMEONE perches on the ottoman.
2288	As he takes a seat facing her.
2289	The kind-faced man crosses his legs.
2290	The psychiatrist patiently lifts his chin.
2291	Narrowing her eyes, SOMEONE gives an appreciative nod and starts to leave.
2292	She halts in the doorway and turns around.
2293	SOMEONE leaves then reappears in his doorway.
2294	As rain pours, party guests in summery clothes crowd a home.
2295	SOMEONE gets food at a buffet while SOMEONE waits on a covered terrace.
2296	Seeing her through a window he notices her watching the man beside him fondling a woman's breast.
2297	SOMEONE pulls the man's hand down and directs their attention to SOMEONE.
2298	The woman scowls and puts her date's hand back on her breast.
2299	SOMEONE brings SOMEONE food.
2300	SOMEONE glances toward the partiers inside.
2301	SOMEONE shifts in his seat and gives a sheepishly obliging shrug.
2302	SOMEONE gives a meek, pleased smile.
2303	Now a bird's eye view shows an umbrella only half sheltering SOMEONE's plate of BBQ.
2304	He and SOMEONE share the umbrella.
2305	SOMEONE sadly throws the plate in a trash bin.
2306	Later at his place.
2307	He grins and SOMEONE gives him an irritated look.
2308	Standing behind her he wraps his arms around her waist.
2309	SOMEONE nods.
2310	He pours Cheerios.
2311	He adds Life cereal to their bowls.
2312	SOMEONE gives him a nod.
2313	SOMEONE pours blueberries over their cereal.
2314	SOMEONE gives her a bowl.
2315	With a mouthful of cereal, SOMEONE shifts her thoughtful eyes.
2316	She gives SOMEONE an expectant look.
2317	SOMEONE shakes his head.
2318	He slaps her shoulder.
2319	As he starts to eat his cereal, SOMEONE gives him an appreciative look.
2320	SOMEONE stops eating and looks over with wide eyes.
2321	He gives a disturbed look and she playfully punches his arm.
2322	Now our view tilts up from the lobby doors past the engraved entablature just below the second story.
2323	SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie with their heads at the foot of his bed.
2324	SOMEONE claps and the lights turn on.
2325	She points at him.
2326	As he leans over her, she punches his shoulder twice.
2327	The lights turn off.
2328	On another day, SOMEONE sits on the bench in the National's bullpen smiling to himself.
2329	He stares off dreamily.
2330	He blinks himself out of his reverie.
2331	An opposing player rounds third toward home plate.
2332	A National's outfielder makes an amazing catch, right over the wall of the bullpen.
2333	His teammates swivel their heads toward him.
2334	Shrugging his hands a ball player rises.
2335	Starting his warm-up he catches a ball.
2336	SOMEONE catches the ball again, then leans toward him.
2337	SOMEONE's shoulders heave.
2338	Later in the National's training room.
2339	SOMEONE holds his phone to his ear as he runs in a pool treadmill.
2340	In her apartment, SOMEONE removes the bag from the trashcan.
2341	She lets the can fall as she goes to the phone.
2342	SOMEONE's jaw drops.
2343	Hanging up, SOMEONE glances around, then returns her attention to the trash bag.
2344	Grinning she flips open her phone.
2345	A trainer brings him ice.
2346	SOMEONE's mouth lifts into a crooked grimace.
2347	SOMEONE shifts her eyes.
2348	With a thoughtful look, SOMEONE hangs up.
2349	Now she packs a duffel bag in her room.
2350	SOMEONE shakes her head.
2351	The assistant coach rises from the arm of a sofa and hugs her.
2352	SOMEONE answers his front door.
2353	She indicates a large stack of bags and suitcases.
2354	In his closet, SOMEONE opens a drawer that's only one third empty.
2355	She nods and they share a smile.
2356	Glancing back at the drawer she shrugs.
2357	Now at an apartment above a bakery.
2358	SOMEONE rises from a desk at a bay window.
2359	Boxes and other packed items line his small living room and hallway.
2360	He opens the door.
2361	SOMEONE carries in a grocery bag.
2362	SOMEONE loads the fridge.
2363	SOMEONE waddles to an armchair and sinks down in it.
2364	She stands.
2365	Standing in front of him, SOMEONE bites her lip and eyes him skeptically.
2366	She takes a few steps away and gives him a sidelong look.
2367	With her thoughtful gaze still locked on his face.
2368	she cocks her heads and studies him.
2369	She sets her hands on her hips.
2370	She juts out her jaw, then curls her lips together.
2371	SOMEONE stands ready to exit his apartment.
2372	She heads to the kitchen.
2373	SOMEONE approaches the Bowlen Building.
2374	Meanwhile, SOMEONE makes a call from the desk in his study.
2375	SOMEONE stops in the lobby.
2376	SOMEONE closes his eyes.
2377	He shuts his phone.
2378	then letting his upper body go limp.
2379	slams his head onto a decorative table and holds it there.
2380	The doorman and a concierge stare at him.
2381	Now SOMEONE trudges into an elevator.
2382	As he rubs his forehead SOMEONE rushes through the open doors.
2383	With a bag of groceries slung over her shoulder, she stands beside him as he rubs his face.
2384	His hand descends to his mouth, pulling down his lower lip.
2385	SOMEONE glances over.
2386	He looks at her, then quickly releases his lip.
2387	Later, SOMEONE follows SOMEONE into SOMEONE's apartment.
2388	carrying the bag of groceries.
2389	She takes it into the kitchen.
2390	SOMEONE looks around.
2391	He hurries over.
2392	Entering, SOMEONE frowns at seeing SOMEONE.
2393	SOMEONE gives a comprehending nod, then smiles at him.
2394	SOMEONE wears a disgruntled look.
2395	Smiling tightly, she jerks her to the side, then moves off.
2396	SOMEONE follows with a long sigh.
2397	SOMEONE peers after them as they enter another room.
2398	SOMEONE stares with disbelieving eyes.
2399	She blinks up at him.
2400	Following her into the hall, he glances at SOMEONE, who looks away.
2401	Now SOMEONE packs.
2402	SOMEONE opens the front door.
2403	and SOMEONE stalks to the elevator with her bags and suitcases in tow.
2404	She steps inside and hits a button.
2405	As the doors slide shut, SOMEONE shakes his head.
2406	He pats SOMEONE's shoulder.
2407	Now SOMEONE races down the stairwell.
2408	jumping onto each landing as he rounds the next flight.
2409	In the lobby.
2410	the doorman rushes to keep ahead of SOMEONE.
2411	and opens the door for her.
2412	She marches outside.
2413	SOMEONE dashes out the main door.
2414	Spotting SOMEONE he skids to a stop and puts on a casual expression.
2415	He pretends to gaze down the street.
2416	He grins.
2417	He takes a bag.
2418	He and SOMEONE start off down the street.
2419	As they head to a bus stop, the doorman answers an intercom phone.
2420	He sets down the phone receiver and jogs toward SOMEONE.
2421	who waits behind SOMEONE a short distance away.
2422	As the doorman opens his mouth to call him.
2423	he notices SOMEONE shaking his head giddily then looking skyward with a grateful smile.
2424	Grinning sympathetically, SOMEONE returns to the intercom.
2425	He watches as SOMEONE follows SOMEONE on to a bus, hauling up her roller bag.
2426	Later at his downsized apartment.
2427	SOMEONE helps SOMEONE carry in her luggage.
2428	She sets down her bags, then takes out her cellphone and charger.
2429	She notes SOMEONE's boxes.
2430	His fridge is packed with food from SOMEONE.
2431	He checks his cell and ignores a call from dad.
2432	He enters the kitchen.
2433	She opens his fridge, finding the vast array of neatly labeled homemade items.
2434	As SOMEONE sets his jacket down she joins him at the counter and grabs a fork.
2435	SOMEONE leaves the galley kitchen.
2436	and unplugs her cellphone from its charger.
2437	She steps aside.
2438	He peeks at her.
2439	Rolling up his sleeves, he smirks.
2440	She faces him.
2441	She tosses down her phone.
2442	SOMEONE considers the idea.
2443	She frowns.
2444	He crosses to the door.
2445	SOMEONE deflates.
2446	Left alone in the cluttered second floor apartment she glances around and wanders over to a bay window.
2447	Peering outside she spots SOMEONE.
2448	who holds up a six-pack of Guinness on his way back across the street.
2449	He runs in front of an oncoming car.
2450	He barely avoids getting hit.
2451	SOMEONE shakes her head and leaves the window.
2452	Now on the phone.
2453	SOMEONE slides open his cellphone and aims it at his sad face.
2454	He checks the pic, then sets up a second shot.
2455	He tilts his head and milks the pout a little more.
2456	Now SOMEONE adds three dashes of bitters to highball glass.
2457	drops in a single sugar cube and measures some Maker's Mark in a metal shot cup.
2458	In the living room, SOMEONE grabs her near-empty glass of Guinness and takes a sip.
2459	SOMEONE squints as he stirs his creation, then smiles.
2460	He shakes the drink.
2461	SOMEONE hears him singing.
2462	She turns to eye him and he stares back, then enters the living room with two cocktails.
2463	SOMEONE downs the last of her Guinness.
2464	She accepts the cloudy, peach tinted beverage.
2465	SOMEONE sits across from her on the floor.
2466	He raises his glass.
2467	He taps her, then taps her again.
2468	She sets her drink aside.
2469	He stands.
2470	SOMEONE straightens her posture.
2471	She sits up.
2472	SOMEONE sits beside her on the couch.
2473	She squints distantly then gestures with her sleeve-covered hand.
2474	SOMEONE lowers her tearful gaze, then notes SOMEONE beside her.
2475	She self-consciously stands up.
2476	She tugs the hem of her shirt and rubs her nose.
2477	SOMEONE watches her pace across the room and take a seat on a cushioned chair.
2478	SOMEONE glances at her host.
2479	SOMEONE brightens.
2480	Laughing uncontrollably, SOMEONE hunches forward.
2481	She leaves her seat and crosses to her phone.
2482	SOMEONE nods softly.
2483	She unplugs her cellphone.
2484	and flips it open to check the caller ID.
2485	He finds a scrap of paper.
2486	His note reads, I went nuts when you left, I broke a lamp.
2487	A shade and exposed light bulb dangle crookedly.
2488	With his back to her, SOMEONE purses his lips and sighs.
2489	He regards her affably.
2490	She eyes him awkwardly as he stands.
2491	Later on the street, SOMEONE raises his arm for a taxi.
2492	He smiles warmly, then resumes trying for a cab.
2493	Unseen by her, SOMEONE makes a fist and grimaces.
2494	He lowers his arm, then turns and faces SOMEONE squarely.
2495	A taxi stops.
2496	SOMEONE smiles, meeting his eyes.
2497	They share a pleasant nod.
2498	SOMEONE taps on the rear of the parked taxi.
2499	He opens the trunk, then helps SOMEONE load in her luggage.
2500	He stows the largest first, then she helps with the two smaller bags.
2501	He smiles and shuts the trunk.
2502	He nods and follows her to the passenger door.
2503	SOMEONE smiles softly, with a touch of sadness, then gets in the cab.
2504	SOMEONE shuts the door, then impulsively leans close to her open window.
2505	They share a warm smile, then he leaves the window and the cab drives away.
2506	SOMEONE watches her go, tightens his lips, then plods back toward his apartment across the street.
2507	Pedestrians enjoy a sunny day by a lofty stone fountain.
2508	SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit on a bench.
2509	SOMEONE glances at her.
2510	He buries his face in his hand and she wraps her arm around him.
2511	Nighttime at the Bowlen Building.
2512	Now SOMEONE stands tensely in an elevator.
2513	Now with his father.
2514	SOMEONE sits on a velvet couch facing his father.
2515	It's SOMEONE plainly.

2541	Back with SOMEONE and SOMEONE.
2542	SOMEONE sits on the couch between SOMEONE and a pillow decorated with a sand crab.
2543	SOMEONE gives a sympathetic pout then screws up his mouth.

2554	He rubs his face with both hands.
2555	SOMEONE hurries out.
2556	Now at a softball game.
2557	SOMEONE applauds from the sidelines.
2558	Fans behind her hold homemade signs and wear American flag patterned clothing.
2559	On the field, her former coaches and teammates congratulate each other.
2560	SOMEONE's smile fades.
2561	The American players line up facing their opponents from Australia and they exchange sporting high fives.
2562	SOMEONE's brow knits and her chest heaves.
2563	She walks away.
2564	Later, she rides a commuter train, woefully biting her thumbnail and fidgeting her fingers.
2565	Now words type out on a computer screen.
2566	Facing his laptop SOMEONE pauses and reads his letter over.
2567	He picks up his cell phone from a stack of papers.
2568	He eyes his cell.
2569	It's SOMEONE, down on the sidewalk.

2579	Rushing around his living room, he gathers up laundry and stacks books on a coffee table.
2580	Downstairs SOMEONE paces before the Cafe/Bakery under his apartment.

2583	she cranes her neck to look up at SOMEONE's window.
2584	Now in his apartment.

2615	SOMEONE gives a relieved smile.
2616	He shakes SOMEONE's hand.

2634	SOMEONE sits.
2635	SOMEONE giddily bites her lip.
2636	Smiling SOMEONE looks to SOMEONE.
2637	and finds him beaming tenderly at her, camcorder in hand.
2638	SOMEONE gives her fiancee an affectionate slug on the shoulder and they share a laugh.
2639	SOMEONE flashes a bashful smile, and shuts the camcorder's display window.
2640	He and SOMEONE stroll outside through the hospital's revolving door.
2641	They walk close together, their hands swinging gently at their sides.
2642	The twosome approaches a bus stop.
2643	SOMEONE stands before SOMEONE as she sits on a bench.
2644	A wistful smile plays on her pixie-like features.
2645	He beams fondly.
2646	A city bus turns into view and nears the stop.
2647	SOMEONE gets to her feet.
2648	Shifts his desperate gaze as the bus doors open.
2649	SOMEONE steps on.
2650	SOMEONE storms off.
2651	As he marches alongside the bus.
2652	SOMEONE watches him through a window.
2653	His arms give an angry flail.
2654	Wearing a confused frown SOMEONE blinks at him.
2655	As the bus pulls away she averts her thoughtful gaze.
2656	Her eyes widen and she pulls the stop cord.
2657	The bus lurches to a halt at the curb.
2658	SOMEONE hurries off and moves around the front of the bus.
2659	Spreading her arms in a bewildered shrug, she strides briskly toward her friend.

2661	Another bus arrives.
2662	SOMEONE's mirthful grin fades.

2670	SOMEONE eyes a list in two columns.
2671	SOMEONE crumples the page and takes out his cell.
2672	He puts the phone to his ear and sits.
2673	In his study, SOMEONE pauses at some paperwork and answers.
2674	He ends the call excitedly.
2675	Back in her own apartment, SOMEONE munches a cracker as she lounges, facing her TV.
2676	In a well-tailored dark gray suit, SOMEONE arrives at his father's building.
2677	At the entrance, sexy model types in slinky clothes line up at a table.

2687	On SOMEONE's vast penthouse patio, elegant place settings line tables.
2688	Two vendors wheeling bushels of live lobsters.
2689	SOMEONE and SOMEONE chat in the walk-in closet.
2690	He pulls out a chair.

2704	She uncurls the bag's crumpled top and reaches inside.
2705	SOMEONE watches as she fishes out a present.
2706	Wrapped in polka dot paper, like a hard candy.
2707	it bears a cheerful red ribbon tied on each end.
2708	SOMEONE gives him a smile, then carefully unties one of the bows.
2709	SOMEONE shifts his anxious eyes between her and the present.
2710	SOMEONE very patiently slides the ribbon off the end of the tube shaped gift.
2711	As she moves on to the other bow, she pauses.
2712	Her eyes flicker over SOMEONE.
2713	He lifts his brow.
2714	With a smile, he watches SOMEONE slide off the second bow.
2715	Unwrapping the gift, she finds a child's tub of Play-Doh.
2716	As she examines it, her diamond watch glitters on her wrist.
2717	He gives her a nod.
2718	He takes the Play-Doh from her and eyes it.
2719	He stares into her eyes.
2720	She holds his gaze for a moment, then looks down with a touched expression.
2721	A hint of tears glistens in her eyes.
2722	She returns her gaze to him.
2723	SOMEONE nods, her eyes glistening.
2724	Her gaze remains locked on him.
2725	and he gives her a tender smile.
2726	She glances at the Play-Doh.
2727	SOMEONE nods, his eyes misty as well.
2728	She shakes her head.
2729	She sets the Play-Doh back inside the paper bag and crumples down the top.
2730	Avoiding SOMEONE's gaze, she stands and he follows suit.
2731	She walks back into the apartment, leaving him staring after her.
2732	Inside, SOMEONE strolls past three chatting women.
2733	She shows them.
2734	As the three women chat, SOMEONE lifts her gaze from the watch.
2735	On the patio, SOMEONE shakes SOMEONE's hand, then hurries along.
2736	He pulls SOMEONE aside.
2737	He winces.
2738	SOMEONE waves at him.
2739	He heads off.
2740	SOMEONE watches with a curious look as SOMEONE opens the door and turns to her again.
2741	He opens his mouth to speak.
2742	Brightly shrugs an arm and lets his fist open up in a self-deprecating flourish.
2743	He leaves.
2744	And SOMEONE's amused smile fades.
2745	SOMEONE joins her.
2746	They head away from their party guests.
2747	Outside by the bus stop a couple strolls by SOMEONE as he paces, his shoulders sagging.
2748	The headlights of passing cars cast their warm glow on the wet pavement.
2749	Inside the apartment.
2750	SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter the vacant bedroom.
2751	SOMEONE closes the door.
2752	He watches as she removes the diamond watch.
2753	SOMEONE shifts her eyes.
2754	She turns to the door.
2755	He nods, his eyes saddened.
2756	His lips fumble.
2757	SOMEONE rushes over and hugs him.
2758	He holds her tightly.
2759	His shoulders heave.
2760	SOMEONE touches her lips to his neck.
2761	SOMEONE continues to trudge back and forth by the bus stop.
2762	On a balcony above, SOMEONE talks on a phone.
2763	He hangs up then pockets his cell.
2764	Looking down he sees his son on the sidewalk.
2765	The lofty view shows SOMEONE fold his arms, bow his head, and stamp his feet.
2766	With a concerned look, he thrusts his hand on the balcony railing.
2767	A lawyer behind him checks his watch.
2768	Down below, SOMEONE exits the building.
2769	She stops just outside the door as she sees SOMEONE.
2770	He gives her a relieved grin.
2771	SOMEONE takes a few steps toward him then pauses.
2772	Shaking his head, SOMEONE shrugs his hands and smiles.
2773	SOMEONE quirks a smile and replies in kind.
2774	SOMEONE beams.
2775	As SOMEONE walks over.
2776	SOMEONE watches from the balcony.
2777	His lips spreading into a grin.
2778	His mouth suddenly drops into a knowing.
2779	He heads back into his apartment.
2780	By the bus stop SOMEONE gazes at SOMEONE.
2781	As she starts for the bus stop, SOMEONE grabs her by the shoulders and presses his lips to hers.
2782	Her brow lifts as he kisses her.
2783	Then her shoulders relax and she wraps her arms around him, pulling him close.
2784	With her eyes closed, SOMEONE rests her face against his shoulder.
2785	SOMEONE leans his head against hers.
2786	His eyes close too.
2787	His smile fades and his eyes pop open.
2788	SOMEONE opens her eyes.
2789	She rolls them, then slides out of SOMEONE's embrace.
2790	She gives him an amused look.
2791	She holds his gaze for a moment, Then walks to the bus stop.
2792	SOMEONE smiles, then follows.
2793	He sits beside her on the bench inside the glass shelter.
2794	Facing her he squares his shoulders.
2795	He smiles.
2796	SOMEONE blinks, then looks away, her brow furrowing.
2797	As she returns her gaze to his.
2798	the corner of her mouth lifts into an astonished smile.
2799	She eyes him for a moment, then turns away.
2800	Reaching over, she places her hand on top of his hand.
2801	SOMEONE closes his fingers around hers.
2802	With a tender expression, SOMEONE watches as she shakes her head.
2803	She meets his gaze with a smile.
2804	SOMEONE grins.
2805	As they sit side by side holding hands.
2806	he leans forward and looks up the street.
2807	He turns to SOMEONE and gives her a nod.
2808	Still holding her hand, he rises.
2809	The bus arrives, eclipsing them from view.
2810	The bus pulls away, leaving the bench inside the quaint shelter empty.
2811	As he and his dark-haired colleague exit onto a college campus, a title appears.
2812	A painted barn declares, "Ohio for Morris. ".
2813	A roadside sign reads, "Pullman, America's Future Begins March 15. ".
2814	Supporters wave homemade posters, including "Gimme More Morris" and "Don't Pull For Pullman. ".
2815	A homeless man's sign states, "Will vote for food. ".
2816	A headline reads, "Ohio Primary Too Close To Call".
2817	The young blonde woman deliver coffees.
2818	The dark-haired campaign staffer drinks a coffee as he watches the debate on TV.
2819	In the auditorium, SOMEONE, a handsome gray-haired man, shakes hands with his balding opponent.
2820	The two candidates wave at the audience.
2821	Standing in a wing, a bearded man with sagging features looks across the stage.
2822	and forces a terse smile.
2823	In the opposite wing, a paunchy, fair-haired man returns the gesture.
2824	The clean cut man joins him.
2825	SOMEONE gives them an inquiring glance.
2826	The two campaign staffers head backstage.
2827	where the bearded man pours himself coffee.
2828	SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE.
2829	Munching on a doughnut, he smirks as he heads off.
2830	Clenching his jaw, SOMEONE shakes his head then strides away, leaving SOMEONE alone with a tense look.
2831	Still onstage, SOMEONE and SOMEONE continue to wave at the audience.
2832	Now, a suited man with a trim mustache plays piano and sings at a bar.
2833	SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit at a table with a dark-haired woman in glasses.
2834	She scrutinizes the fair-haired campaign manager.
2835	A guy brings drinks.
2836	SOMEONE's grin fades.
2837	He slaps the table.
2838	He leaves SOMEONE alone with SOMEONE.
2839	She gives SOMEONE a pitying look.
2840	Gazing back at her with confident eyes, he shakes his head.
2841	The singer croons into his microphone.
2842	Now holding a briefcase, SOMEONE exits the bar with SOMEONE.
2843	He lights a cigarette.
2844	The next day at SOMEONE's campaign headquarters.
2845	SOMEONE shakes a box.
2846	Entering an office with tall windows that look out into the bullpen, SOMEONE sits at a desk.
2847	The young blonde woman walks in holding a folder.
2848	Barely looking at her, he opens the folder and starts reading.
2849	He returns the folder to her.
2850	She gives a mocking grin.
2851	He jots a note then looks at her.
2852	He smiles to himself as she leaves.
2853	He gives an embarrassed nod.
2854	then sits back in his chair and gazes after her.
2855	In a stately home.
2856	SOMEONE leans closer to Senator SOMEONE.
2857	A woman in a gray blazer and ribbed sweater sets two glasses of whisky on a table between them.
2858	He keeps his sharp-eyed gaze locked on SOMEONE at SOMEONE's headquarters.
2859	then holds out a laptop.
2860	As SOMEONE reads the documents.
2861	SOMEONE waits with a bemused smile.
2862	His lips screw to one side impatiently.
2863	Seated facing him, SOMEONE interlaces his hands on a conference table.
2864	The other staffers swap uneasy looks.
2865	SOMEONE brings SOMEONE a printout of the op-ed piece.
2866	As SOMEONE smirks, the governor cracks a smile.
2867	The young adviser flashes a cocky grin.
2868	SOMEONE goes to his office and picks up the phone.
2869	He shuts his door.
2870	Leaning against a reflective window, SOMEONE knits his brow and takes a breath.
2871	SOMEONE ends the call in his dimly lit office.
2872	On the other end, SOMEONE slowly twirls the phone in his hand as he hangs it up.
2873	Through the window, he gazes out at SOMEONE and his diligent campaign staff.
2874	as he makes a call on his cell.
2875	He hangs up.
2876	Now, a neon sign reading "Head First" hangs in a window.
2877	flanked by shutters painted with the words "Who Dey. ".
2878	SOMEONE sits in his car, staring at the bar.
2879	Later inside.
2880	SOMEONE regards SOMEONE with a cool, amused gaze.
2881	SOMEONE scrutinizes his rival's earnest face.
2882	His eyes gleaming in the dim light, SOMEONE abruptly gets to his feet and heads for the door.
2883	Now SOMEONE talks on his cell as he steps into the daylight.
2884	Silhouetted against the sunny day, he faces the bar's door frame and leans his head against it.
2885	Now in a hotel suite, a woman applies makeup to SOMEONE.
2886	In the next room, SOMEONE brings SOMEONE a file and sits by him.
2887	SOMEONE has drinks with SOMEONE in a bar.
2888	His brow raised, SOMEONE manages a nod.
2889	She gives him an alluring smirk.
2890	SOMEONE looks the young woman up and down.
2891	He stares at her rosy lips.
2892	She returns a cool, enticing smirk.
2893	SOMEONE's heavy-lidded eyes remain fixed on her face.
2894	He nods, suppressing a grin.
2895	SOMEONE rubs her lips together, then gives a wicked grin.
2896	Now, the bus sits haphazardly parked outside SOMEONE's hotel.
2897	SOMEONE leaves his bed.
2898	SOMEONE gets dressed as he talks.
2899	She fastens her jeans.
2900	She gives a cool shrug.
2901	She knots his tie.
2902	She kisses him and turns away.
2903	Now at an airport, SOMEONE uses his cell.
2904	Beneath an overcast sky, SOMEONE halts and turns on his heel.
2905	Ending the call, he crosses a tarmac to a private jet.
2906	Later in flight, he works beside SOMEONE who sits facing SOMEONE.
2907	Turbulence jostles the aircraft causing SOMEONE to look up from his work.
2908	He braces himself and shuts his eyes.
2909	With a wry smile, SOMEONE glances out his window.
2910	SOMEONE tenses as the plane jostles again.
2911	Delivering his speech.
2912	SOMEONE glances at a woman and child off stage.
2913	SOMEONE and SOMEONE stands silhouetted against an American flag.
2914	SOMEONE delivers his speech on the other side of the flag.
2915	SOMEONE bows his head and massages his brow.
2916	Backstage, SOMEONE shakes his head.
2917	SOMEONE strides away.
2918	Standing silhouetted against the backwards side of the American flag with his arms folded across his chest.
2919	SOMEONE hangs his head.
2920	Now SOMEONE climbs a set of stairs in the filled auditorium.
2921	She exits into a corridor where a bearded campaign staffer hands her some papers.
2922	Taking them, she skims the top page as she heads down the hallway.
2923	past a "Morris for President" banner along the wall.
2924	She jogs up a stairwell to a pair of closed doors where SOMEONE and his Secret Service agents stand guard.
2925	SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the papers.
2926	In the middle of an empty rehearsal room.
2927	SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE sit with their chairs huddled together.
2928	As his campaign manager talks, the governor glances down and shoots a look at his young press secretary.
2929	SOMEONE nods, his arms folded.
2930	Pursing his lips into a resolute line, SOMEONE pats his own leg.
2931	SOMEONE talks on the phone.
2932	At night, the campaign bus drives down the highway.
2933	We follow it from an SUV.
2934	Resting her head on his shoulder, his wife smiles.
2935	SOMEONE lifts his eyes for a moment.
2936	She shakes her head.
2937	He kisses her forehead.
2938	Closing her eyes, she nuzzles into his shoulder.
2939	Setting his lips in a firm line, he glances at his wife.
2940	She lifts her face to meet his gaze.
2941	Now at a town hall meeting.
2942	SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a phone and returns to the meeting.
2943	Later that night, the campaign bus cruises down a highway.
2944	On board, SOMEONE squints at a laptop screen from behind a pair of glasses.
2945	An instant message from SOMEONE pops up.
2946	A smile spreads across SOMEONE's face.
2947	and he removes his glasses.
2948	Looking over his shoulder, he spots SOMEONE a few seats back.
2949	She meets his gaze with a mischievous smile, then lowers her head and shakes it coyly.
2950	Turning forward again, SOMEONE slides on his glasses and resumes working.
2951	Later at his hotel, pale light edges his bare back as he and SOMEONE have sex.
2952	SOMEONE glances at the town hall meeting on TV.
2953	SOMEONE kisses him.
2954	He buries his face against her neck.
2955	Later, she sleeps beside him as he sits in bed working on his laptop.
2956	His gaze sweeps over the covers.
2957	He wrungs his hands over the comforter, then searches inside its folds.
2958	Finding his cellphone, he answers.
2959	He pulls it away from his ear and frowns at it.
2960	With a puzzled look, he turns to a bedside table and spots his own phone sitting on top.
2961	He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, then wakes SOMEONE.
2962	He hits redial.
2963	With the cell to his ears, SOMEONE's playful expression fades as he listens.
2964	Noting his reaction, SOMEONE sucks in a quick breath then averts her ashamed gaze.
2965	SOMEONE lowers the phone and stares at it.
2966	Hanging up, he shifts his eyes to SOMEONE.
2967	who continues to look down.
2968	She reluctantly meets his gaze, her eyes glistening with tears.
2969	SOMEONE stares at her with wide eyes.
2970	He lowers his gaze.
2971	SOMEONE shifts nervously as he paces in front of the bed.
2972	SOMEONE stares at her, his lips parted slightly in a stunned look.
2973	A tear slides down SOMEONE's face and she swallows hard.
2974	Turning away, he gives a tiny shake of his head.
2975	The next day.
2976	SOMEONE strides down a sidewalk.
2977	with his hands in the pockets of his dark trench coat, and his jaw set tight in a resolute expression.
2978	Reaching campaign headquarters, he glances at an idealized poster of SOMEONE in a window.
2979	then swings open the door to the bullpen and steps inside.
2980	Sitting behind a desk near the front of the room, SOMEONE glances up at him.
2981	SOMEONE shoots her a brief look as he moves past the desks of the busy staffer.
2982	With his lips set in a troubled line, he enters his office, takes a seat at his desk.
2983	and stares out through the windows of the bustling bullpen.
2984	His gaze sweeps from some people examining writing on a whiteboard to the desks of other campaigners making phone calls and typing on laptops.
2985	He stares at the back of SOMEONE's head as she works.
2986	Pushing his chair away from his desk, he gets up.
2987	and raps his knuckles on a side window which shows SOMEONE working next door.
2988	SOMEONE glances over.
2989	Moving from the window, SOMEONE slides off his coat and drops it in a chair.
2990	He rests a hand on the open door as SOMEONE enters.
2991	SOMEONE closes the door behind him.
2992	then sits on the edge of his desk and folds his arm.
2993	He opens the door for SOMEONE to exit.
2994	The staffers in the bullpen pause and look over.
2995	He heads back into his office.
2996	SOMEONE anxiously gets up from her work and follows him.
2997	As SOMEONE enters the office.
2998	he continues writing.
2999	then shoots the bullpen a cautious look as he hands her the slip of paper.
3000	On SOMEONE' campaign stationary, it reads, "Meet me in the stairwell at noon. ".
3001	SOMEONE's shoulders rise with a relieved breath.
3002	She returns the note to him and he rips it up.
3003	He avoids her gaze.
3004	With a dejected nod, she leaves.
3005	Later, SOMEONE removes his wallet from his coat pocket.
3006	as he approaches the entrance to the Stock Yards Bank and Trust.
3007	At a counter, he waits as a teller tallies a handful of bills and sets them in front of him.
3008	He tucks the cash in his wallet.
3009	Now, he takes a call as he exits the bank.
3010	SOMEONE stops in his tracks, his brow furrows.
3011	She strides off.
3012	Now, SOMEONE uses a payphone.
3013	A man photographs a woman nearby with his camera pointed in SOMEONE's direction.
3014	A news van sits parked at the curb.
3015	He hangs up and hurries out of Fountain Square.
3016	Now pale, hazy light hangs low behind the Cincinnati skyline.
3017	At SOMEONE's campaign headquarters.
3018	SOMEONE enters a dark stairwell and climbs up past the first landing.
3019	She stops halfway to the second one and looks around.
3020	SOMEONE emerges from the shadows.
3021	She continues up the stairs and joins him on the second landing.
3022	SOMEONE gives him a tearful, dejected look.
3023	Now, in SOMEONE's hotel room.
3024	SOMEONE gets a text from SOMEONE, "noon tomorrow. ".
3025	He eyes his cellphone.
3026	It reads SOMEONE calling.
3027	SOMEONE pockets the phone and tightens his jaw.
3028	SOMEONE waits in a car outside a motel with the campaign bus parked nearby.
3029	SOMEONE comes out.
3030	He watches her approach.
3031	His gaze softens as it returns to SOMEONE who carries a coat draped over her arm.
3032	She gets in beside him and they share a brief look.
3033	Now we peer up at the Roebling Suspension Bridge.
3034	SOMEONE drives SOMEONE across.
3035	Leaning back against her headrest, she swallows and lifts her chin, then briefly closes her dark-lashed eyes.
3036	She looks to SOMEONE with a vulnerable pout.
3037	He keeps his inscrutable gaze fixed on the road.
3038	SOMEONE turns away sadly and stares ahead.
3039	Later, the car turns onto a city street.
3040	As it pulls into a parking lot, it passes a sign reading, "Oakley Women's Clinic of Cincinnati.
3041	" Now SOMEONE fills out paperwork at a reception desk while SOMEONE waits beside her.
3042	She turns in the forms to a nurse who hands SOMEONE a pink printout.
3043	He folds it in half as the woman speaks to him.
3044	Nodding, he replies, "Okay. ".
3045	He and SOMEONE sit down in the otherwise empty waiting room.
3046	Neither of them looks the other in the eye.
3047	As he faces SOMEONE, she returns a stunned expression.
3048	She looks away, her lips trembling.
3049	She glares at SOMEONE with tears in her eyes.
3050	He gets to his feet.
3051	He kisses her forehead, and goes.
3052	She tearfully works her jaw as she looks away.
3053	Now SOMEONE lies on his rumpled bed in his hotel suite, talking on his cellphone.
3054	He gets up.
3055	He answers the door.
3056	SOMEONE swigs from a bottle of water.
3057	Working on a laptop nearby, SOMEONE looks back and forth between them.
3058	SOMEONE reclines in his chair.
3059	His hands on his hips, he shuffles closer to the campaign manager.
3060	He sinks down in a chair, leans forward, and interlaces his hand.
3061	SOMEONE stares at him with a lifted brow.
3062	He averts his gaze and shuts his laptop.
3063	He takes it out of the room.
3064	SOMEONE's brow knits in a bewildered frown and he opens his hands.
3065	His arms folded, the campaign manager calmly regards him without a trace of remorse.
3066	SOMEONE lowers his mouth to his upraised hand and shakes his head.
3067	SOMEONE takes out his cigarettes.
3068	He gets to his feet and paces.
3069	His eyes wide.
3070	SOMEONE nods, then looks away.
3071	At the women's clinic, SOMEONE slumps back in a waiting room chair, her hands over her lower abdomen.
3072	A nurse hands her a prescription pill bottle.
3073	SOMEONE eyes the label and nods receptively as she listens.
3074	The nurse then hands her another bottle of pills.
3075	SOMEONE nods again with a grave frown.
3076	Her eyes drift back and forth from the nurse to the bottles in her slender, graceful hands.
3077	SOMEONE meets the woman's gaze with wide eyes and gives a final nod.
3078	As the nurse steps away, the young abortion patient briefly musters a smile for her.
3079	Now, SOMEONE loosens his tie and sighs tensely as he drives down a city street.
3080	At the clinic, a lamp softly illuminates the dusky waiting room.
3081	as SOMEONE clutches her medicine in a bag between her knees.
3082	She shifts pensively in her chair.
3083	On the road, SOMEONE stares ahead with a sullen gaze.
3084	Outside the clinic, SOMEONE clutches her coat around her as she leaves on foot.
3085	She glances at traffic on the road beside her, and then approaches a cafe.
3086	Later, she sits inside in a booth by a window.
3087	As the sky grows darker outside, she peers out in the clinic's direction, then checks her watch.
3088	Lifting her gaze, she stares off grimly.
3089	As SOMEONE drives on, we glimpse the sunset outside.
3090	At night, he finally arrives outside the clinic.
3091	Finding it closed, he drives on.
3092	Outside her motel, SOMEONE exits a taxicab.
3093	She lets SOMEONE into her room.
3094	SOMEONE's eyes glisten.
3095	Her jaw drops open in a horrified expression.
3096	Leaning forward, she brings a hand to her mouth and shifts her hopeless, tearful gaze.
3097	Now SOMEONE marches purposefully down a sidewalk, his jaw set tight.
3098	He arrives at a storefront with a banner over the entrance reading, "Pullman for President", and goes in.
3099	He holds his wrathful gaze fixed straight ahead.
3100	At the far end of the campaign headquarters, SOMEONE meets with colleagues in a dimly lit office.
3101	He spots SOMEONE and gives a grim smirk.
3102	Later, they enter another small office together.
3103	SOMEONE glances back at the departing staffer, and then faces SOMEONE.
3104	SOMEONE steps in closer, his face half-obscured in shadow.
3105	He gives a nod.
3106	SOMEONE abruptly turns away and leaves the room.
3107	SOMEONE lingers, gazing after him with gleaming eyes.
3108	Now we view him from behind as he drives.
3109	With a slow, steady rhythm, his wiper sweep rain from his windshield as the city lights twinkle outside.
3110	Later at SOMEONE's motel, he exits the car.
3111	Indoors, we peer down through a narrow gap at a stairwell banister and glimpsed SOMEONE climbing up.
3112	Arriving in a hallway, he spots a man using a walkie-talkie as he hurries from a room.
3113	SOMEONE continues coolly down the hall.
3114	Arriving at the door to SOMEONE's room, he tenses as he finds it ajar.
3115	He gives it a knock, then pushes it open.
3116	A shadowy figure sits on the bed with his back to us.
3117	SOMEONE makes his way over with a furrowed brow.
3118	He halts and stares down with glistening eyes.
3119	Her face out of view behind the bed, SOMEONE lies motionless on the floor, her legs and left arm splayed awkwardly.
3120	Fighting tears, SOMEONE steps a little closer.
3121	Holding the room's phone to his ear, the man on the bed regards him sympathetically.
3122	SOMEONE sees the pill bottles on a bedside table.
3123	SOMEONE notices SOMEONE's cell peeking out from under her coat on the bed.
3124	With his back turned to him, the man on the bed sits in silhouette against the room's soft lamp light.
3125	Later, SOMEONE steps back out into the rainy night.
3126	Moving with a stiff gait, he marches across the parking lot to his car.
3127	As he gets in, rain patters heavily against his windshield.
3128	The wipers move in a slow rhythm against the downpour.
3129	The water cast modeled shadows against SOMEONE's face as he steers off forlornly.
3130	He sets SOMEONE's phone down, and takes out his own.
3131	and scrolls through the menu to check his messages.
3132	His eyes welled with tears.
3133	The next day at campaign headquarters, SOMEONE and the others watch a news report.
3134	Now, as a figure sits on a bench facing the Ohio River.
3135	SOMEONE's lanky frame steps into view.
3136	He walks up to the bench and takes a seat.
3137	Both men stare out over the river's slate gray water towards Cincinnati on the other side.
3138	As traffic moves across the nearby Roebling Bridge, Senator SOMEONE narrows his eyes and wets his lips.
3139	SOMEONE regards him with a sober frown and nods.
3140	SOMEONE faces him with a furrowed brow and glances warily past his shoulder.
3141	The young man stares at the senator through narrowed eyes, his lips pressed tightly shut.
3142	SOMEONE reaches out hesitantly, then gives his leg a brisk pat and leaves.
3143	Now at a press conference, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the other staffers flank SOMEONE as he gives a statement.
3144	He looks to SOMEONE and moves up to the podium.
3145	SOMEONE steps aside and checks his cell.
3146	The phone display reads, "Molly calling. ".
3147	SOMEONE scans the room and his gaze falls on two police officers.
3148	Noting their casual expressions, he looks past them to other attendee.
3149	He finds SOMEONE holding SOMEONE's cellphone to his ear.
3150	A flashbulb pops on the governor's wide-eyed stare.
3151	SOMEONE lowers the phone with a cold expression.
3152	SOMEONE clenches his jaw.
3153	Nighttime.
3154	Seen from behind, SOMEONE leads us down a sidewalk, following the wall of a shadowy brick building.
3155	Two black SUVs wait outside the closed establishment.
3156	SOMEONE stops and peers in through a window with open blinds on the inside.
3157	He enters a front vestibule and steps into the dim establishment.
3158	As he peers across the room, all but the lower quadrant of his face remains cast in shadow.
3159	At the end of a long empty bar, a man stands in silhouette in the dark.
3160	SOMEONE crosses the darkened room, passing a dozen unoccupied barstools.
3161	He steps past the motionless Secret Service agent and heads through an illuminated doorway to a kitchen.
3162	He crosses a well-lit section on his way to another darkened area.
3163	Beyond stock shelves on a center counter, light shine under an industrial range hood.
3164	SOMEONE shifts his gaze.
3165	He ambles around the counter and finds the governor.
3166	SOMEONE turns away.
3167	He abruptly returns his gaze to the former staffer and the two maintain eye contact.
3168	Shadow conceals all but a lower quarter of the governor's face.
3169	SOMEONE draws a tense breath.
3170	SOMEONE remains still.
3171	SOMEONE steps from the shadows, his right eye becoming glaringly visible in the dim light.
3172	SOMEONE swallows his smirk.
3173	His expression hardens.
3174	SOMEONE remains poker-faced.
3175	SOMEONE maintains eye contact with SOMEONE who glowers and swallows.
3176	In a barbershop, a seated a bibbed SOMEONE gets a haircut by a barber standing behind him.
3177	Our view slowly roves around the side of the paunchy, middle-aged campaign manager.
3178	who gazes flatly from under his wrinkled brow.
3179	Later, SOMEONE steps outside wearing his thick-rimmed glasses.
3180	Beyond him, a black SUV idles just footsteps away.
3181	Poking out of a nearby alley, another sits parked by the curb.
3182	The campaign manager lights a cigarette then notices the SUV.
3183	Taking a few drags, he heads down the sidewalk and approaches the vehicle in the alleyway.
3184	A backseat window rolls down revealing SOMEONE inside.
3185	The tinted window rolls up and SOMEONE manages a final pull on his cigarette.
3186	He stubs it out on a wall and climbs into the SUV.
3187	A head-on view of the black car gradually drifts toward the grill.
3188	Its front tires rest in a buildup of icy gray slush on the alley apron.
3189	To the left, exhaust blooms from the tailpipe of the second SUV.
3190	The view keeps inching toward the nose of SOMEONE' vehicle until most of the second SUV falls out of view.
3191	The forward moving trip ceases halfway across the street.
3192	The backdoor opens.
3193	SOMEONE steps out and shuts it behind him.
3194	The SUV pulls out of the alley and drives off, followed by its twin.
3195	With his hands in his coat pockets, SOMEONE peers after them.
3196	He shifts his wry and resigned gaze.
3197	Now on a hotel room, SOMEONE watches TV while shaving.
3198	Now, a hearse and three black cars wait outside a cathedral.
3199	Inside, a dark wood coffin topped by an arrangement of white flowers lies at the front of a packed sanctuary.
3200	SOMEONE Stearns stands at a podium.
3201	The bereaved father swallows, then glances upward.
3202	Among the attendees.
3203	SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE who sits across the aisle a few rows up.
3204	He returns his attention to the chairman who wipes his nose.
3205	The distraught father nods, then lowers his gaze and hangs his head.
3206	Later as SOMEONE exit the cathedral, SOMEONE smokes a cigarette as he ambles across a wintry lawn of dead grass.
3207	He approaches SOMEONE.
3208	He heads off.
3209	SOMEONE gets into his car.
3210	Now, SOMEONE stands at a podium with SOMEONE and his wife beside him.
3211	The crowd of excited supporters wave American flags and hold signs.
3212	SOMEONE stands motionless toward the back.
3213	SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap grins.
3214	SOMEONE whispers in his endorser's ears.
3215	They shake hands.
3216	Outside, a brunette young woman carries two trays of coffees.
3217	The intern strides briskly with the delivery.
3218	She marches past an information booth, enters the crowded hall.
3219	and brings SOMEONE one of the coffees.
3220	SOMEONE nods.
3221	SOMEONE gazes absently.
3222	Now, the new campaign manager leads the way down a hall into a room marked "Morris Event Staff Only. ".
3223	Staff members sit at laptops facing three flat screens.
3224	SOMEONE accepts his jacket from a colleague and puts it on.
3225	As SOMEONE leaves, a TV shows an interview with SOMEONE.
3226	The brunette intern faces SOMEONE.
3227	Outside, SOMEONE marches across a walkway and heads up the front steps of the campus building.
3228	Later, he heads down an empty stairwell.
3229	SOMEONE waits in a corridor.
3230	She follows SOMEONE down the hall toward a pair of imposing guards.
3231	He dons his ID.
3232	They share a knowing gaze, then SOMEONE files past one of the security guards.
3233	Walking in our direction, he crosses a darkened corridor, his face cast in shadow.
3234	An overhead light briefly reveals the young campaign manager's emotionless gaze.
3235	As he continues his stride, another overhead offers a second glimpse of his plain look.
3236	In a dim gymnasium, an empty canvass and wood director's chair awaits.
3237	Beyond it, the lone campaign manager emerges as a blurry form from the corridor.
3238	SOMEONE arrives at the makeshift set and takes a seat under a spotlight.
3239	illuminating a patch of the otherwise darkened gym floor.
3240	A soundman outfits him with an earpiece while a makeup artist touches up his face.
3241	The makeup artist leaves.
3242	As the soundman preps him for the interview, our view gradually orbits around the side of SOMEONE's face.
3243	SOMEONE nods, gazing straight ahead with a deadpan expression.
3244	As our view finally settles facing the young campaign manager, SOMEONE looks to his left.
3245	He notices the blonde-haired makeup artist admiring him, then faces the camera and lowers his gaze.
3246	We gradually press in on the campaign manager's handsome face, his eyes downcast.
3247	SOMEONE looks directly at us.
3248	He mimes being dead.
3249	At his house in Vail, Colorado.
3250	SOMEONE steps forward and embraces SOMEONE.
3251	Now, he and his wife and their party guests raise glasses.
3252	A man with boyish features holds up a hand.
3253	He puts an arm around his wife.
3254	SOMEONE pours himself coffee.
3255	Now, four skiers stop on a slope.
3256	SOMEONE and his son take off down the mountainside.
3257	Meanwhile, SOMEONE pulls into the State Park.
3258	He hangs a handicap-parking pass on his rear view mirror, then jumps out of the car.
3259	He races into the woods.
3260	On a mountain, a man spies on a bird.
3261	A skier crashes into him.
3262	The girl's father drops his head into his folded arms.
3263	Reaching a lake's edge, she spots a bird through his binoculars.
3264	Turning, he sees a massive birder snapping shots of his find.
3265	In Colorado, SOMEONE and his son ski side by side down a slope.
3266	Swerving off to the side, SOMEONE skids to a stop.
3267	His son looks over.
3268	A tally appears, clicking from zero to one.
3269	The tally ticks to two.
3270	Now, an SUV screeches to a halt and SOMEONE snaps a photo out his window.
3271	The tally clicks to three.
3272	Later, SOMEONE packs his belongings into an SUV.
3273	SOMEONE's Day One tally shows 29.
3274	At the park, SOMEONE returns to his car.
3275	His eyes widen and he races back into the woods.
3276	As his camera flashes, his Day One tally clicks from 30 to 31.
3277	Now, a view through binoculars shows a flock of seagulls.
3278	Standing at an office window, SOMEONE lowers the binoculars and sighs.
3279	His Day One tally clicks to one.
3280	Later, he sits at the dinner table with his father.
3281	Smiling, SOMEONE's mom sits.
3282	His dad lifts his brow.
3283	SOMEONE releases his fork.
3284	SOMEONE storms off.
3285	Now, with his boss.
3286	He shows a photo of two kids.
3287	SOMEONE turns away.
3288	He halts.
3289	SOMEONE drives.
3290	He brakes.
3291	A plane flies.
3292	A car arrives outside a Victorian style house.
3293	SOMEONE passes through its gate and spots a sign - Stay on path.
3294	As an old woman answers the door, words appear- Gibson's, British Columbia.
3295	SOMEONE arrives behind SOMEONE.
3296	SOMEONE runs to the back of the house.
3297	She offers the key, then pulls it back.
3298	SOMEONE climbs over a fence.
3299	SOMEONE runs back to his car, his tally ticking to 159.
3300	The woman gives SOMEONE the key.
3301	In the heavy downpour, SOMEONE's car peels away.
3302	As SOMEONE follows the drenched path to the fence, he answers his cell phone.
3303	The key sticks in the gate's lock.
3304	He tries ramming the gate with his shoulder as his associates listen.
3305	Trying to climb the wood plank fence, SOMEONE steps on a garden gnome posted at the gate.
3306	As he scans the garden, the ceramic sculpture shatters under his weight.
3307	SOMEONE turns to find the hummingbird flying over the gate.
3308	His jaw drops as the emerald hued bird hovers over his head.
3309	In slow motion, we watch the beats of its tiny wings.
3310	As it flies off, SOMEONE beams after it and his tally ticks up to 158.
3311	SOMEONE snaps photos as a skinny man in a turban seated nearby uses a laptop to write a blog titled The Joy of Birding with Ichabod Cranes.
3312	SOMEONE abruptly turns away, listening.
3313	Climbing down off a boulder, he loses his footing and falls.
3314	Landing, he crawls along the ground, then flops over and snaps photos of a bird in flight.
3315	His tally ticks to 132.
3316	On a dock, SOMEONE's eyes narrow as SOMEONE approaches.
3317	SOMEONE draws a knife.
3318	SOMEONE signs autographs, then faces SOMEONE.
3319	Now, the boat travels over the tranquil waters of the Sound.
3320	On the deck, a mustached birder performs a birdcall for a pretty brunette who listens keenly.
3321	SOMEONE nods humbly.
3322	The mustached man looks up.
3323	He moves off and others follow him.
3324	Nearby, a man cuts up fish on a board.
3325	SOMEONE notices SOMEONE popping pills nearby.
3326	He remembers passing by him at the house in Canada.
3327	The workman dumps fish parts over the rail.
3328	SOMEONE queasily eyes the cutting board, then faces SOMEONE.
3329	The older man vomits over the deck railing.
3330	A workman hands over a crumpled rag.
3331	Later, SOMEONE rests on an indoor bench piled with luggage.
3332	He feebly gives SOMEONE the so-so gesture.
3333	SOMEONE points outside where birders flock around SOMEONE as he does bird calls.
3334	As SOMEONE shakes his head, both their tallies appear.
3335	On land the mustached birder brings coffee.
3336	Now, SOMEONE's mother uses a phone.
3337	He angrily ends the call.
3338	Our view contracts around an owl in a nearby tapestry.
3339	It comes to life and flies at us.
3340	At the wheel of a car, SOMEONE wakes to find himself in the path of an 18-wheeler.
3341	He wrenches the wheel, waking his companion.
3342	Narrowly avoiding the truck, the car skids off the road and slams sideways into a tree.
3343	Leaving the mustached birder in the passenger seat, SOMEONE lowers his window, then climbs out of the car through it.
3344	He faces the tree, grimly inspecting the damage to the car's back door.
3345	SOMEONE turns wide-eyed.
3346	The champion birder ventures into the thick evergreen forest.
3347	In the passenger seat, the mustached birder keeps one arm at his side as he starts to turn in his seat.
3348	He winces and unbuckles his seat belt, then reaches into the back.
3349	He comes out following SOMEONE.
3350	The champion looks up.
3351	Green leafy branches form a canopy overhead, but give no sign of a bird.
3352	He treks further into the woods.
3353	Shifting his searching gaze, SOMEONE moves a branch aside, then halts at the side of a black and white woodpecker.
3354	Now, in a humble bathroom, SOMEONE uses his cell phone as his socks dry on a line.
3355	A view from her suite shows the Eiffel Tower.
3356	Now, a toilet bursts through a window.
3357	It lands outside SOMEONE's house.
3358	A handsome man arrives.
3359	At an actual dump, SOMEONE snacks on chips.
3360	Other birders wretch and cover their noses.
3361	Impervious to the stench, SOMEONE photographs a bird among the refuse.
3362	His two associates arrive.
3363	He photographs them.
3364	SOMEONE gets in a car.
3365	SOMEONE backs out of his parking spot.
3366	Now, April 19th, Day 109.
3367	A silver luxury car pulls up in front of the SOMEONE's house.
3368	The champion birder gets out to find scaffolding framing the entire left wing of his home.
3369	The upper left quarter stands stripped of its siding.
3370	SOMEONE takes it in unhappily, then pulls his bags from the backseat and approaches the house.
3371	The handsome man stands with an older man.
3372	He goes inside.
3373	He moves through a maze of exposed wood framework.
3374	She emerges from the master bathroom.
3375	She puts on a robe.
3376	He grabs her.
3377	Kissing her, he steers her to the bed.
3378	He pauses from their kiss.
3379	Straddling his lap, she kisses him back.
3380	The TV shows a weather report.
3381	SOMEONE's eyes stray to the TV.
3382	In a store, SOMEONE watches the same report.
3383	In New York, SOMEONE watches the report on a TV behind his office building security desk.
3384	SOMEONE follows her husband's gaze.
3385	He tosses her onto the bed and runs out.
3386	As he climbs into his car, SOMEONE glares down from an open patch in a wall.
3387	She throws up her hands and SOMEONE speeds off.
3388	From the yard, SOMEONE glances up at the disgruntled wife.
3389	Meanwhile, SOMEONE races to his boss's office and bursts in.
3390	SOMEONE stares.
3391	He climbs into a car.
3392	The vehicle peels out.
3393	Later, the three birders talk on their cells.
3394	A red line on a map tracks SOMEONE's progress to High Island.
3395	Now, people in cars flock into a grassy parking lot.
3396	SOMEONE parks amid the crowd and gazes at the sky.
3397	SOMEONE gets out of his car.
3398	Climbing out of his vehicle, SOMEONE breaks into a smile.
3399	Birds fill the sky above the trees, speckling it with clusters of black dots.
3400	Racing to the front of the crowd, SOMEONE crosses in front of a cameraman filming a reporter.
3401	He shoves past two men.
3402	He flips them off as he gazes through his binoculars, then heads away.
3403	Later, birds flit overhead as SOMEONE walks a path in the woods, his eyes fixed skyward.
3404	He lifts his binoculars to watch a red bird in a tree.
3405	Gazing over SOMEONE's shoulder, SOMEONE notices SOMEONE.
3406	They hurry after SOMEONE, who disappears into some trees.
3407	As other birders look through binoculars and snap photos, SOMEONE rushes past them and briefly eyes a bird on a tree.
3408	He runs off.
3409	SOMEONE and SOMEONE stop as well to see the little yellow bird.
3410	Slowing his pace, SOMEONE briefly peers through his binoculars.
3411	He runs off.
3412	SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive a moment later.
3413	As they continue after SOMEONE, all of three of their tallies appear, counting up past 300.
3414	Through his binoculars, SOMEONE follows a bird, then spots the pretty brunette from the boat.
3415	She sees him and he waves.
3416	SOMEONE steps into his line of sight.
3417	SOMEONE sprints off.
3418	At a bridge, he picks up a little girl in a uniform who partially blocks the entrance and sets her aside.
3419	SOMEONE and SOMEONE approach the bridge.
3420	She gestures to a group of girls.
3421	The two birders wait as the uniformed girls pass.
3422	As the last explorer crosses, SOMEONE and SOMEONE hurry down the narrow bridge turning sideways to pass others.
3423	They reach a platform looking out onto a lake.
3424	He strides off.
3425	SOMEONE and SOMEONE share an exasperated look.
3426	Later, SOMEONE's two competitors sit at a table in an elegant restaurant.
3427	The waiter heads off and SOMEONE frowns.
3428	SOMEONE bulks at his girth.
3429	The waiter returns.
3430	SOMEONE's face remains blank as he sips his drink.
3431	Lowering the glass, he nods.
3432	SOMEONE takes a long drink.
3433	Later, they stroll outside.
3434	SOMEONE extends his hand to shake, but SOMEONE leans forward and gives him a hug.
3435	At a motel.
3436	She discards a needle.
3437	SOMEONE smiles.
3438	Now, in the deck of her boat, SOMEONE stares through binoculars, then points.
3439	SOMEONE writes his find in a daily journal, then notices a man with shaggy brown hair staring through binoculars.
3440	He sets down his journal and walks over.
3441	He nudges the guy.
3442	Turning away from the stranger, SOMEONE staggers briefly, then rests his hand against the ferry's frame.
3443	His eyes widen and he stifles a gag.
3444	As he rushes inside, leaving his belongings behind, Crane creeps over and picks up SOMEONE's journal.
3445	He glances around, then flips through it.
3446	Now, SOMEONE sits in his cubicle at his otherwise vacant workplace and pulls up Crane's blog on his computer.
3447	He smiles as he reads.
3448	SOMEONE glares.
3449	Now SOMEONE talks on the phone.
3450	He checks his call waiting.
3451	SOMEONE switches to the other line.
3452	Now, our view soars over jagged snowy mountains.
3453	SOMEONE wears a T-shirt and boxers.
3454	Now, they speed down a highway.
3455	She swerves in front of a car.
3456	Meanwhile, a helicopter soars toward New York's towering skyscrapers.
3457	On a helipad, a man opens the door.
3458	Later, in the meeting.
3459	SOMEONE glares and SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a look.
3460	SOMEONE gives a tight affirming smile.
3461	SOMEONE leans toward SOMEONE.
3462	He stands.
3463	With sagging shoulders, SOMEONE glances at his watch, then gives a resigned nod.
3464	Later, he, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit at the conference room table while McIntyre talks outside with his associates.
3465	SOMEONE shoots his watch a furtive glance.
3466	McIntyre returns to the conference room.
3467	He stands.
3468	He talks on his cell as he exits the building.
3469	He waits by the curb as his driver pulls the car up beside a row of taxis.
3470	He jumps in the back.
3471	He checks the time.
3472	Grimacing, he slumps against the seat.
3473	Now, a small plane sits on a runway.
3474	As she turns away, SOMEONE eyes her new husband.
3475	He mouths, Attu? What were you thinking?.
3476	But the guy gives a dismissive wave.
3477	SOMEONE stumbles aboard.
3478	He stows his bags on an overhead shelf.
3479	He takes a seat across the aisle from SOMEONE, then notices the champion birder eyeing him.
3480	SOMEONE allows a nod, then settles in his seat.
3481	Now, the pilot pushes the plane's throttle and the craft begins to move.
3482	In the cabin, SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
3483	A taxi skids around the Merrill Airfield hangar, kicking up dust.
3484	SOMEONE hurries out with his bags in hand.
3485	The plane turns onto a runway.
3486	On board, SOMEONE shrugs.
3487	SOMEONE's eyes widen.
3488	SOMEONE runs for the plane.
3489	He spies SOMEONE through a window.
3490	The plane lifts off the runway.
3491	SOMEONE drops his bags.
3492	He doubles over defeatedly.
3493	On a map, a red arrow extends from a point on the Alaskan coast to the Aleutian Islands halfway across the ocean.
3494	As we descend toward the farthest one, real clouds blanket our view.
3495	The plane bounces with turbulence.
3496	The plane jostles violently.
3497	Bags fall from the overhead shelves.
3498	Shrieking hysterically, SOMEONE grips the seat in front of her with both hands.
3499	The co-pilot glances back from the cockpit.
3500	More luggage falls as the plane swoops through a range of jagged mountains.
3501	SOMEONE tensely looks across the aisle.
3502	Calmly nibbling a cookie, SOMEONE returns a cordial smile.
3503	The plane lands roughly.
3504	SOMEONE sobs in her husband's arms while SOMEONE sits frozen with a scowl.
3505	Now, the birders march single file down a path cutting through a field at the base of a mountain.
3506	SOMEONE hikes casually behind the newlyweds, admiring his surroundings.
3507	SOMEONE's duffel bounces against his leg with each stride.
3508	As the birders arrive at a remote compound, an old woman inside peers out a dingy window.
3509	She sits and uses a PA microphone.
3510	Now, a pair of doors slides open revealing the inside of a Quonset hut set with two rows of bunk beds.
3511	SOMEONE's husband takes in the crude quarters with a grin, barely registering her glum pout.
3512	SOMEONE steps up behind them.
3513	He strolls pass the bunks, then moves through a humble dining area.
3514	A seated woman high fives him as he passes.
3515	Reaching the room's far wall, he shoves a row of lockers to one side revealing a hidden door.
3516	He opens it with a cocky smirk to reveal a small private room.
3517	The others stare as he sets down his things.
3518	Opening a small chest filled with personal items, he takes out a pair of green drawstring pants.
3519	In the common sleeping area, SOMEONE sets his bags on a lower bunk.
3520	A rat runs along a shelf by the headboard.
3521	SOMEONE springs up and hits his head on the top bunk.
3522	He scrambles wildly off the bed, grabbing his duffel and peers after the rat with a fearful stare.
3523	He sees the pretty brunette chatting with a tall guy.
3524	SOMEONE approaches her.
3525	The pretty brunette swings her legs around obliviously kicking him in the face.
3526	Recovering, he dances from foot to foot as he tries to find a path to his bunk while the other birders rush past him.
3527	Outside, they climb on bikes and ride off.
3528	Munching cereal, SOMEONE lounges in the dining area in his green drawstring pants.
3529	SOMEONE narrows his eyes at him, then rushes out to find the other birders riding off.
3530	Donning a knit hat, he grabs one of the few remaining bikes and awkwardly peddles after them.
3531	Now, on a rugged gravel trail.
3532	The birders turn.
3533	SOMEONE stretches as he strolls outside in his green pants.
3534	Wildlife footage shows a sea bird landing among some penguin stealing their fish and flying off.
3535	Now, the birders use binoculars to scan a snowy field near the base of a mountain.
3536	SOMEONE squints in the sunlight.
3537	As he turns hurriedly, his feet slip out from under him.
3538	He lands on his back in the snow as his fellow birders rush past him.
3539	He peers through his binoculars like the others.
3540	A small flock of birds takes flight, but one lingers behind.

3967	SOMEONE grabs the necklace near the two tickets on her desk.
3968	The closet.
3969	SOMEONE parts the hanging clothes and takes out a jacket.
3970	She crosses the room to retrieve something from a drawer, then returns to SOMEONE.
3971	She places it in her hand.
3972	As SOMEONE leaves, SOMEONE opens her hand to find a set of large drop earrings with yellow toned stones.
3973	She looks at herself in the mirror.
3974	Tucking her hair back behind one ear, she studies the unpierced lobe.
3975	SOMEONE flashes a little smile at her reflection, and takes a step closer to the mirror.
3976	She raises an earring to her lobe, and winces as she begins to drive it through.
3977	The post pops through the back of the lobe.
3978	She adjusts the backing, then lowers her hand to find a drop of blood on her thumb.
3979	She licks it off.
3980	As the young woman gazes wide eyed at her reflection, a smile spreads across her lips.
3981	Later, SOMEONE sends a text message to Stephen, Sorry, next time.
3982	She and SOMEONE wander off through the gallery.
3983	Nighttime.
3984	At the dorm, our view slowly moves down the dimly lit hallway.
3985	In her room, SOMEONE sits up in bed and rubs her brow.
3986	She groggily gets up and crosses the dim room.
3987	At the foot of her roommate's bed, she kneels before a mini fridge.
3988	The roommate stirs in her sleep.
3989	SOMEONE opens the door and takes out a near empty plastic water bottle.
3990	She closes the refrigerator.
3991	She goes to the door.
3992	Opening it, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE sitting in the hallway.
3993	Glaring, the pale blonde stands.
3994	SOMEONE strides closer to Tracy, who leans back and eyes her nervously.
3995	SOMEONE looks her up and down.
3996	SOMEONE gapes at the intimidating young woman.
3997	With a look of disgust, SOMEONE walks away.
3998	SOMEONE watches her go, then lowers her frightened gaze.
3999	Daytime.
4000	SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk across the campus.
4001	SOMEONE catches up with SOMEONE.
4002	Frustrated SOMEONE watches SOMEONE walk away, then notices SOMEONE spying on her from behind a low brick wall.
4003	Wide eyed, SOMEONE leaves.
4004	Now in Professor SOMEONE's class.
4005	She receives a text from SOMEONE.
4006	SOMEONE smirks.
4007	Now SOMEONE steps outside to find SOMEONE with a coffee.
4008	She crosses a sidewalk.
4009	Inside, she ascends a spiral staircase.
4010	She enters designers room.
4011	Now in a library, SOMEONE studies alone at a table.
4012	SOMEONE sets down her bag and takes a seat beside him.
4013	Now at the dorm.
4014	Passing a row of toilet stalls, we glimpse the bottoms of the porcelain bowls under the partition doors.
4015	Our view lifts to the bathroom door where the handle begins to turn.
4016	In her shower stall, SOMEONE runs a hand down her soaked hair.
4017	Glistening trails of water glide down her smooth back.
4018	She soaps her hands, then washes her stomach.
4019	A belly ring shimmers on her navel.
4020	As she rubs suds on her wet abdomen, the lights in the bathroom suddenly turn off.
4021	She pulls back the shower curtain.
4022	She stares at its drawn curtain, then steps toward it.
4023	SOMEONE reaches in and turns off the shower.
4024	She looks around, her eyes wide.
4025	Her body trembles slightly as she gazes out at the seemingly empty bathroom.
4026	With cautious steps, she moves to the adjacent shower stall and peers at its drawn curtain.
4027	Stepping up to it, she lifts a hand to the opaque plastic.
4028	Pulling back the curtain, she finds another vacant stall.
4029	Water streams from the shower head onto the tile floor.
4030	SOMEONE turns away from the stall, her hands still clutching its curtain.
4031	Doffing her towel, she steps back into her shower.
4032	As she washes her hair, a hooded woman tears down the curtain and pushes her to the floor.
4033	Later, in room 316, drops of water fall from the sleeve of SOMEONE's sweatshirt as it hangs from the back of her chair.
4034	She sits on her bed, petting Cuddles.
4035	Hurriedly turning of her bedside lamp, she huddles under her covers.
4036	She watches as shadows pass by beneath the door, then sits back up.
4037	She grabs her phone off her bedside table and hits speed dial.
4038	Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold hands as they step out of the dorm's elevator.
4039	She smiles as he leans in and kisses her.
4040	Breaking off the kiss, SOMEONE sees her roommate.
4041	As she storms off, SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE.
4042	They watch as SOMEONE returns to the room.
4043	Standing in the elevator, SOMEONE stops the closing door, leans out, and gives her one last kiss.
4044	The roommates walk through the campus, both staring straight ahead.
4045	SOMEONE stops her.
4046	As SOMEONE turns away, SOMEONE gently grabs her again.
4047	Now she opens SOMEONE's profile on a social networking site.
4048	A photo is captioned - My best friend SOMEONE and me.
4049	SOMEONE gives her a good-humored look.
4050	Through a plate glass window across the way, we watch the couple at their library table.
4051	As SOMEONE stands, our view shifts to show SOMEONE staring at them through the glass.
4052	SOMEONE kisses Stephen, then leaves him at the table.
4053	Now SOMEONE creeps between two stacks in the library.
4054	On the other side of one, SOMEONE searches through books.
4055	As he makes his way down the stack, SOMEONE runs his finger along a row of books, examining their spines.
4056	SOMEONE stalks him closely.
4057	Stopping, SOMEONE pulls out a book from a shelf to reveal her watchful eye.
4058	Not noticing her, he heads to the end of the aisle, and SOMEONE moves with him, concealed by the bookshelves.
4059	Lowering his gaze to his book, SOMEONE obliviously walks past her.
4060	He pauses and turns back, but finds no one there.
4061	Now SOMEONE catches up to SOMEONE on a campus walkway.
4062	SOMEONE hurries toward them.
4063	SOMEONE strides away.
4064	Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare at a grand view of downtown.
4065	She rests her chin on his shoulder.
4066	SOMEONE glances at her, then smiles.
4067	Now they hang from a set of monkey bars, their legs bent away from the ground.
4068	He eyes her bare midriff.
4069	Grinning, she turns away.
4070	Later, they kiss heatedly.
4071	He open the door.
4072	Glances at the door.
4073	A clock reads 12:55.
4074	SOMEONE stands, grabs her phone, and eyes its display.
4075	She throws it onto her bed.
4076	Turning to SOMEONE's side of the room, she eyes her roommate's bedside table.
4077	Opening its drawer, she finds SOMEONE's cellphone inside.
4078	SOMEONE removes the phone and answers.
4079	She lifts it to her ear.
4080	Meanwhile, SOMEONE removes SOMEONE's shirt.
4081	In the dorm room, SOMEONE twitches a smile, then sits on SOMEONE's bed.
4082	In the frat house, SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE.
4083	We flash between SOMEONE's room and the dorm.
4084	As the couple makes out, SOMEONE lies back on SOMEONE's bed with her eyes closed.
4085	Holding the phone to her ear, she stares off with a distant look.
4086	On SOMEONE's bed, her jacket removed and her lover lowers himself on top of her.
4087	Meanwhile, SOMEONE's chest heaves.
4088	She eyes the framed photo of SOMEONE and SOMEONE on the bedside table.
4089	Her eyes close as she touches herself.
4090	He presses his lips to Sarah's, then grazes his nose against her cheek.
4091	SOMEONE's brow creases in ecstasy, her lips.
4092	SOMEONE closes her eyes as SOMEONE kisses her neck.
4093	SOMEONE's lips spread into a sultry expression as she speaks.
4094	He kisses her neck.
4095	She smiles.
4096	SOMEONE gazes at SOMEONE.
4097	SOMEONE stares off with vacant eyes.
4098	She hangs up.
4099	SOMEONE returns to the dorm room.
4100	Cuddles scurries out to the hall.
4101	SOMEONE runs after her.
4102	The RA picks up the kitten.
4103	Taking her, SOMEONE heads away.
4104	She walks back into her room.
4105	Nighttime.
4106	She brings out another armful of clothes.
4107	SOMEONE sets down the clothes.
4108	SOMEONE eyes her.
4109	Later, SOMEONE scrolls through an online profile, looking at photos of SOMEONE with beautiful women.
4110	SOMEONE puts away her new clothes.
4111	She sits beside SOMEONE.
4112	Staring at Sarah, she clamps her mouth shut, then averts her gaze.
4113	SOMEONE returns to the closet.
4114	SOMEONE sulks.
4115	At work, SOMEONE uses her phone.
4116	Only a few patrons sit inside the calm coffee house.
4117	SOMEONE sets her phone on the counter and lowers her gaze.
4118	In the dorm room, SOMEONE carries Cuddles to a laundry basket and sets her on top of some clothes.
4119	She brings the basket with the kitten into a laundry room.
4120	Picking up Cuddles, she carries her to a dryer and opens the door.
4121	She sets her inside.
4122	As she closes the door, the kitten presses its paw to the glass.
4123	She feeds coins into the machine.
4124	Later, SOMEONE returns to the room to find her crying.
4125	SOMEONE hugs her.
4126	SOMEONE gives her an irritated look.
4127	She leaves.
4128	Later, SOMEONE picks at a cup of fruit as she sits across from SOMEONE in the cafeteria.
4129	She gazes intently at her roommate, who glances up from the fruit cup.
4130	In class, the students pack up their belongings and head out.
4131	His eyes drift to SOMEONE's lips.
4132	He leans in and kisses her.
4133	She recoils, shooting him a disapproving look.
4134	He leans back in his seat.
4135	Now SOMEONE marches down an aisle between library bookcases.
4136	Reaching a table, she plops down in a seat facing SOMEONE.
4137	SOMEONE lowers her disgusted gaze and purses her lips.
4138	SOMEONE smiles and leans closer to SOMEONE.
4139	SOMEONE lays a hand on hers.
4140	SOMEONE stares at it.
4141	A pair of feet in seductive high-heeled shoes stride down a hall bathed in dim red light.
4142	SOMEONE arrives in the doorway to professor SOMEONEs's office.
4143	Putting on a jacket, he pauses.
4144	SOMEONE enters and shuts the door behind her.
4145	As she picks up a photo, SOMEONE tucks off his wedding ring.
4146	The professor moves in close.
4147	SOMEONE stares at him, then shuts her eyes and parts her lips.
4148	The professor gently kisses her mouth.
4149	He regards her questioningly.
4150	SOMEONE puts her fingers to her mouth and gives a Lolita-esque smile.
4151	With a lustful smirk, SOMEONE kisses her more hungrily.
4152	A recording device.
4153	He reaches for it.
4154	SOMEONE kneels down beside the professor.
4155	Feebly lunges for the recorder, but she moves back.
4156	She coldly turns away.
4157	Daytime.
4158	SOMEONE goes to her design class and finds a middle-aged woman at the front.
4159	SOMEONE turns to a classmate.
4160	Later, SOMEONE brings dishes to the counter.
4161	He kisses her sweetly.
4162	SOMEONE smiles.
4163	She fingers the rosy spot.
4164	Screwing up her doll-like features, she hits herself again.
4165	She repeats the process over and over.
4166	Later, our lowering gaze takes in a nasty welt on her arm, then bruises on her outer thigh.
4167	A brief dreamy smile flits across SOMEONE's face.
4168	From a jar of art supplies, she takes out a utility knife.
4169	Pressing her thumb to a switch on its side, she slides the blade's tip out from its metal handle.
4170	SOMEONE lifts up her shirt, revealing her smooth flat abdomen.
4171	Her brow furrowed, she puts the knifepoint to the side of her stomach.
4172	The troubled young woman closes her eyes, winces, and rips the knifepoint across her flesh.
4173	Now beneath a photo of a statue depicting a screaming man, she lies on her bed.
4174	SOMEONE rocks her injured roommate.
4175	Noticing blood, she gingerly lifts up SOMEONE's shirt.
4176	SOMEONE lies back down with a miserable pout.
4177	Daytime.
4178	SOMEONE walks outside with SOMEONE.
4179	They kiss.
4180	SOMEONE hands her a bag.
4181	SOMEONE pulls up in her convertible, and SOMEONE gets in.
4182	SOMEONE glances at her and she looks away.
4183	Later in the speeding car.
4184	Security gate with a key code panel.
4185	A sprawling mansion peeks out from behind lush trees beyond it.
4186	SOMEONE shifts her uncomfortable gaze.
4187	Later, the car passes working gardeners as it travels up a driveway to the gorgeous Greek-style home.
4188	SOMEONE leads her guest into a sunny foyer.
4189	A crystal chandelier hangs from the vaulted ceiling.
4190	A tall man with thinning hair arrives with a petite elegant redhead.
4191	He kisses her cheek.
4192	Her father shifts his uneasy gaze.
4193	Her parents face SOMEONE tensely.
4194	SOMEONE leads SOMEONE into a sizable bedroom decorated in shades of gray and periwinkle, and shuts the door.
4195	SOMEONE crawls onto a luxurious bed and rolls over on her back.
4196	SOMEONE steps farther in, taking in her surroundings.
4197	SOMEONE notices a collection of drawings on a wall.
4198	They all feature the same brunette with almond-shaped eyes.
4199	Now in a dining room, SOMEONE takes a big bite of Thanksgiving turkey, and SOMEONE responds with a warm appreciative smile.
4200	Both parents stare at their plates.
4201	SOMEONE sips his wine and glances at Sarah, who musters a tight smile.
4202	SOMEONE beams cheerily.
4203	Now in the darkened house, SOMEONE comes downstairs in a t-shirt and sweatpants.
4204	He lumbers groggily into the kitchen and opens the refrigerator, its light spilling into the room.
4205	He turns with a start.
4206	She sits glumly at an island counter.
4207	Upstairs, SOMEONE sits up in bed.
4208	Later, she arrives downstairs in a camisole and knee-length lounge pants.
4209	Crossing the foyer, she peers through the partially open kitchen door.
4210	SOMEONE sits by his daughter, staring ahead.
4211	He faces SOMEONE, who stares at the counter.
4212	The troubled young woman sullenly obeys.
4213	SOMEONE lingers at the door, listening intently.
4214	SOMEONE's brow knits.
4215	SOMEONE stands.
4216	SOMEONE slips out of view.
4217	SOMEONE remains at the counter, wearing a morose pout.
4218	Daytime.
4219	As SOMEONE stands in the foyer, SOMEONE comes in.
4220	SOMEONE blinks at her.
4221	Upstairs, SOMEONE steps into view.
4222	SOMEONE leaves as her daughter arrives downstairs.
4223	SOMEONE gazes after her, then follows SOMEONE out.
4224	Later, the two girls follow a sidewalk past a brick wall.
4225	Her arms folded across her chest, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE.
4226	A smile spreads across SOMEONE's pale face.
4227	SOMEONE takes a sip.
4228	Three girls halt at the entrance, their smiles fading.
4229	Two of them face their brunette friend.
4230	SOMEONE follows SOMEONE's gaze to them.
4231	As the brunette waits outside, her two friends come in, glaring at SOMEONE as they pass by.
4232	The troubled blonde glances at the girls as they place their order, then answers her roommate with a cryptic gaze.
4233	Looking outside, SOMEONE notices the brunette hunched uneasily at a table.
4234	The brunette's friends rejoin her with drinks.
4235	Putting her coffee on the table, she stands and goes outside.
4236	The brunette looks up wearily as SOMEONE approaches.
4237	SOMEONE arrives at her roommate's side.
4238	SOMEONE offers a gentle smile.
4239	The three girls huddle uncomfortably, shifting their uneasy gazes.
4240	SOMEONE looks up at SOMEONE, who glares resentfully at her.
4241	She smiles meekly at Sarah, and they head off.
4242	SOMEONE's brow knits.
4243	The troubled girl pauses and turns back.
4244	SOMEONE stands, takes a step closer, and looks her in the eye.
4245	SOMEONE's faint hopeful smile fades.
4246	She stares at SOMEONE, who gravely stands her ground.
4247	Her eyes glistening, the troubled blonde musters a smug smile, then follows SOMEONE off.
4248	She speeds down a tree lined street, scattering fallen autumn leaves in its wake.
4249	At the wheel, SOMEONE stares ahead with a dull expression.
4250	Riding shotgun, SOMEONE maintains a cheery clear-eyed gaze.
4251	SOMEONE watches her roommate flip open her cellphone.
4252	The woman scowls resentfully at the phone, then eyes her roommate.
4253	Now back at the dorm, SOMEONE takes out her ear buds as she walks down the hall in exercise clothes and running shoes.
4254	She arrives at her room, sweat glistening on her face and throat.
4255	SOMEONE faces her displayed drawings.
4256	She shoulders her bag and smiles.
4257	With a sunny grin, SOMEONE leaves.
4258	SOMEONE notices her sketchpad lying on her bed.
4259	Taking an uneasy breath, she approaches the spiral-bound notebook.
4260	She cheerfully takes it from the bed.
4261	She leaves again, shutting the door behind her.
4262	SOMEONE glances at the bed, then creeps to the door.
4263	Opening it, she peers down the hallway.
4264	She finds no sign of her roommate.
4265	Returning inside, SOMEONE yanks open the drawers of SOMEONE's desk, one after another, anxiously searching their contents.
4266	She flips through a couple of sketch pads and finds a yellow prescription pill bottle.
4267	A hand grabs her shoulder.
4268	SOMEONE hugs her boyfriend.
4269	SOMEONE's red convertible pulls into a gas station.
4270	Inside, a worker watching a football game spots her through the window and gets up.
4271	Outside, SOMEONE leans to her car's tank.
4272	The toothpick-chewing attendant approaches.
4273	Sidling up to her, he leans against the car.
4274	She forces a smile, then watches him place his hand on her hand.
4275	He caresses her cheek, and she squirts his crotch with gasoline.
4276	She drops the nozzle.
4277	She opens a zippo.
4278	She smiles, and he runs away.
4279	She caps the lighter.
4280	Now in the dorm, SOMEONE types Zyprexa into a Wikipedia search field.
4281	She faces a mirror, rubbing a finger over her lips.
4282	SOMEONE enters and stands at the next mirror over to fix her hair.
4283	As SOMEONE touches up her lip-gloss, she glances at the younger blonde.
4284	SOMEONE slides in close.
4285	They slowly bring their lips together for a long soft kiss.
4286	The woman smiles.
4287	SOMEONE grins.
4288	She plays with SOMEONE's hair.
4289	She hands back the lip-gloss and they leave.
4290	Daytime.
4291	SOMEONE jogs up to SOMEONE's apartment building.
4292	At the entrance, she enters a number into an intercom.
4293	SOMEONE walks out to a curb, then peers up the side of the multi-story building.
4294	She glances up and down the street, then adjusts her ear bud and leaves.
4295	Now a sideways image shows SOMEONE walking down the dorm hall.
4296	In their room, SOMEONE sits on her bed.
4297	SOMEONE sits on her roommate's bed.
4298	Now the two young women head through a shop selling lots of black clothes and miniskirts.
4299	They reach a small tattoo parlor at the back, and face a wall displaying numerous designs.
4300	SOMEONE walks into a back room with a tattoo artist.
4301	Sitting on a couch in a waiting area, SOMEONE picks up a magazine and flips through it.
4302	Later, she drops the magazine and picks up another.
4303	SOMEONE comes out from the back, her hands clasped at her chest.
4304	SOMEONE puts down the magazine and stands.
4305	She faces her smiling friend, who peels back a layer of plastic to reveal a tattoo of the name SOMEONE over her heart.
4306	SOMEONE's eyes widen.
4307	SOMEONE steps back a bit.
4308	SOMEONE's smile fades.
4309	SOMEONE swallows, her eyes glistening with tears.
4310	He sets down the crate.
4311	From their dorm room, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE load the crate into the back seat of a taxi.
4312	SOMEONE enters to find her sitting on the windowsill.
4313	SOMEONE barely shakes her head no.
4314	He crouches and opens a drawer.
4315	She takes his picture with her camera.
4316	Now at the frat house.
4317	He smells the clothes.
4318	Unpacks the crate.
4319	She finds SOMEONE's brown spiral notebook inside.
4320	She finds an unfinished drawing of herself.
4321	Flipping through the subsequent pages, she finds more and more portraits, each more detailed than the last.
4322	Now we drift high over the intersecting pathways on the quad.
4323	SOMEONE nervously glances about as she walks alone down a set of steps.
4324	Halfway down, she halts and scans the entire area before continuing on.
4325	Nighttime.
4326	SOMEONE steps out of the coffee shop.
4327	She walks home alone on the dark deserted street.
4328	She notices someone walking in her direction.
4329	SOMEONE squints at the slender hooded figure as the person draws near.
4330	She averts her gaze as they pass each other.
4331	As SOMEONE continues on, the hooded figure stops and watches her go.
4332	SOMEONE glances back and sees the person walking away.
4333	Now SOMEONE enters the frat house and shuts the door.
4334	She finds a group of frat guys playing video games and allows a smile.
4335	Daytime.
4336	In SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE's cellphone vibrates.
4337	She flips it.
4338	SOMEONE glances at her.
4339	Outside the dorm building, a guy holds a cellphone to his ear.
4340	Two students step outside, and SOMEONE hurries over to catch the open door before it shuts.
4341	In SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE looks up from her books.
4342	At the dorm, SOMEONE follows the hallway.
4343	He stops at room 316 and knocks.
4344	Inside, we drift backward, away from the door.
4345	SOMEONE sits in a plain armchair.
4346	Wearing an anguished frown, she repeatedly stabs the utility knife into the chair's armrest.
4347	SOMEONE looks up at the door.
4348	She concentrates on the handle.
4349	In the hall, SOMEONE jots a note to SOMEONE - I'm here, and I just want to see you.
4350	He includes his hotel and room number and signs - Love, SOMEONE.
4351	He slips it under the door.
4352	SOMEONE rises from the armchair and picks up the note.
4353	At the library, SOMEONE takes notes as she studies.
4354	Later, she opens SOMEONE's wardrobe, then grabs a bottle of SOMEONE's perfume.
4355	Looking at herself in the mirror, she puts on SOMEONE's fedora.
4356	She strokes the SOMEONE tattoo, which peeks over her black SOMEONE bra.
4357	Now SOMEONE opens a wide bureau drawer containing only SOMEONE's necklace.
4358	She fastens the chain around her neck.
4359	Later still, at the Rosewell Hotel, a chambermaid pushes a supply cart down a hallway.
4360	SOMEONE exits the elevator dressed like SOMEONE.
4361	She watches the maid unlock a door down the hall.
4362	As the maid tends to the room, SOMEONE crosses to the cart and steals a key card off of it.
4363	Now outside room 210, SOMEONE inserts the card into the electronic slot on the door.
4364	Inside, SOMEONE sleeps soundly.
4365	SOMEONE slides into the room and shuts the door behind her.
4366	As she removes her black sleeveless top, SOMEONE remains asleep on his side, his back to her.
4367	SOMEONE slides off her jeans.
4368	She eases into bed behind him and gets under the comforter.
4369	She rubs his shoulder and kisses his back.
4370	He smiles, his eyes still closed.
4371	The bleary-eyed young man glimpses SOMEONE's necklace and familiar tattoo.
4372	She pulls the utility knife from her bra strap and raises it.
4373	SOMEONE opens his eyes, SOMEONE plunges the knife downward.
4374	She stabs him again.
4375	SOMEONE's head presses to his pillow, then his wide eyes go lifeless.
4376	At the library, SOMEONE packs up her books.
4377	She receives a text message from SOMEONE - Urgent, I need you right away.
4378	At SOMEONE's posh apartment building, SOMEONE crosses the lobby.
4379	The door slides open and she steps in the elevator and hits number six.
4380	Her gaze drifts to the digital display as it counts upward.
4381	SOMEONE waits with a faint smile.
4382	Now the door slides open, and SOMEONE steps into a hallway.
4383	She pauses in front of SOMEONE's apartment as she finds the door ajar.
4384	With a puzzled look, SOMEONE peeks inside.
4385	Pushing the door all the way open, she walks into the dark apartment.
4386	As she heads down a hall, she pulls her phone from her bag and checks it.
4387	Sheer curtains at the end of the hall billow in front of an open window.
4388	Turning a corner, SOMEONE narrows her eyes as she heads toward SOMEONE's bedroom.
4389	Its door hangs partially open as well.
4390	SOMEONE draws closer, and finds the bedside lamp on and the comforter on the bed rumpled.
4391	She opens the door wider and steps into the room.
4392	SOMEONE aims a revolver at her.
4393	SOMEONE sits.
4394	SOMEONE kneels in front of her.
4395	She touches SOMEONE's hair.
4396	She glances at her restrained friend.
4397	Point blank at SOMEONE's head.
4398	SOMEONE smiles tearfully.
4399	She shakes out a plastic bag.
4400	She went out of the room searching for the weapon.
4401	SOMEONE closes and locks SOMEONE's bedroom.
4402	SOMEONE reaches for the fire escape.
4403	He pulled her back through the window.
4404	SOMEONE smiles down at her.
4405	He hauls her up.
4406	They both fell down.
4407	SOMEONE grabs the gun from SOMEONE's waist.
4408	She smiles and reaches out.
4409	SOMEONE grips the gun with both hands.
4410	She flinches, her smile vanishing.
4411	SOMEONE squeezes the trigger again.
4412	SOMEONE gives a dejected pout.
4413	SOMEONE stands, with the gun still in her hand.
4414	She resists desperately.
4415	SOMEONE leans over SOMEONE.
4416	She stabs SOMEONE in the back with a utility knife.
4417	SOMEONE drops to her knees.
4418	She reaches backward, her fingers straining for the knife.
4419	She topples onto her side.
4420	SOMEONE looks over at SOMEONE.
4421	Still bound to the bed, the young woman stares down at the fallen killer.
4422	With a wince, SOMEONE sits up partway.
4423	She strains to move herself along on her arms, and fixes her eyes on SOMEONE.
4424	She leans in and reaches a hand toward SOMEONE's necklace, still worn by the motionless psychopath.
4425	Holding her breath, SOMEONE inches her fingers closer, almost touching the necklace.
4426	SOMEONE opens her eyes and grabs SOMEONE's wrist.
4427	Her chest heaves.
4428	SOMEONE's eyelids droop, and her eyes roll back in her head.
4429	SOMEONE yanks her wrist from the dead woman's grasp.
4430	SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's necklace in her hand and gives it a tug.
4431	She retrieves it from SOMEONE's neck.
4432	With a final look at her ex-roommate, SOMEONE crawls over to SOMEONE.
4433	He stirs as she lies down beside him.
4434	Draping an arm across his chest, she rests her head on his shoulder, and he places his hand on her head.
4435	Daytime.
4436	A clear blue sky sprawls above SOMEONE as she stops in front of her dorm, gazes at it, then heads inside.
4437	SOMEONE enters room 316, its walls now bare and its contents packed in suitcases and boxes.
4438	She slides a duffle bag off her shoulder.
4439	Sitting on her bare bed, she scans SOMEONE's former half of the room.
4440	With a pained expression, she lowers her gaze.
4441	SOMEONE enters.
4442	He turns to leave.
4443	Now SOMEONE drags the extra bed out of her room.
4444	A set of swings and a climbing frame stand in a rural backyard, along with a picnic table and a brick barbecue.
4445	An upstairs window looks out over the scene.
4446	Inside a framed photo on a bedside table shows a smiling family.
4447	Mum, dad, and a young boy and girl.
4448	The dad wears a clerical collar.
4449	Suddenly, the same man leans up on his elbows in bed.
4450	His eyes darting feverishly around the simply furnished room.
4451	He relaxes and sits up.
4452	The man, SOMEONE, comes out of his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms.
4453	He walks along the landing in his bare feet and comes to a closed door with some hand drawn children's pictures stuck to it.
4454	SOMEONE pauses for a moment to listen at the door.
4455	Then, returns to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks on the way.
4456	He is in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face.
4457	SOMEONE crosses the bathroom and stares out of the door, his toothbrush in his mouth.
4458	He strides across the landing, opens the door to the children's room and glances around.
4459	A younger man in a similar rural style bedroom, suddenly, jolts and tumbles out of bed.
4460	He jumps to his feet and strains to listen.
4461	SOMEONE rushes out of his wooden farmhouse and heads towards a whitewashed barn, while the younger man runs down a flight of steps from the other floor.
4462	SOMEONE and the young man, SOMEONE, charge through a field of tall green maize.
4463	They stop when they reach a gap.
4464	And look along a clear pathway, which cuts through the crop.
4465	A dark haired girl of about six-years-old stands a little further down the path.
4466	The two men run over to her, and SOMEONE grabs her by the arms.
4467	SOMEONE picks up people dashes on through the maize.
4468	He reaches a fair haired boy of about 10, who stares glassily across the field.
4469	SOMEONE turns SOMEONE's head to face him.
4470	SOMEONE puts his hand around his father's jaw, and turns his head to face in the direction he had been staring.
4471	SOMEONE stands and slowly walks through the maize, followed by SOMEONE, who's still carrying SOMEONE in his arms.
4472	SOMEONE stops and glances around anxiously.
4473	He swallows hard and tentatively steps forward onto a sea of flattened maize stalks.
4474	SOMEONE stares in wonder as he, people come to the perimeter of a vast circular expanse of flattened maize.
4475	Two large Alsatians pace around uneasily in the center.
4476	An aerial view shows SOMEONE and his family standing in the circle, which is about 100 yards in diameter.
4477	Another crop circle lies beside it.
4478	It's the same size, but has a small semi-circle of maize still standing within it.
4479	A path leads from the side of the circle, splitting into two prongs.
4480	A third crop circle has two straight lines at either side, and a circle of maize remaining in the center, with another path leading off from its side.
4481	It splits into three larger prongs, the central one of which points towards a smaller circle.
4482	SOMEONE is on the phone as he looks out of his window at the yard.
4483	He bows his head.
4484	SOMEONE steps into the kitchen.
4485	One of the dogs lies on the floor near a puddle of liquid.
4486	People lead the Alsatian into the backyard.
4487	SOMEONE crosses the kitchen and pulls some paper towels off a roll.
4488	He dabs at the urine, saturating the towels.
4489	Then, stands and walks back across the kitchen.
4490	A dark haired woman in a police uniform leans casually in a doorway leading to the front hall.
4491	SOMEONE sighs wearily and gazes at SOMEONE.
4492	In the yard, SOMEONE's at the smoking barbecue.
4493	He sticks a fork in a chicken wing and turns it over.
4494	One of the Alsatians watches SOMEONE from the veranda.
4495	The other one, Houdini, lies slumped in the yard with SOMEONE kneeling in front of him.
4496	SOMEONE walks across to SOMEONE as she drinks from a large glass of water.
4497	SOMEONE kneels beside his sister, and drinks from the tall glass.
4498	He gives her the glass.
4499	SOMEONE carefully pours the water into a metal dog bowl, and slides it across the grass to Houdini.
4500	The Alsatian suddenly jerks his head up towards SOMEONE.
4501	SOMEONE jumps back in shock.
4502	And SOMEONE frowns.
4503	SOMEONE stands.
4504	Houdini stands up and SOMEONE freezes.
4505	The stalks all lie in the same direction.
4506	SOMEONE shakes his head.
4507	She looks across the field.
4508	SOMEONE stares thoughtfully into space.
4509	He rises and slowly walks towards the edge of the circle.
4510	SOMEONE stands and watches him with a slightly puzzled expression.
4511	SOMEONE gazes across the field.
4512	People emerge through the tall green crop and look around anxiously.
4513	SOMEONE spots something over to his left and strides briskly towards it with a concerned expression.
4514	SOMEONE follows him.
4515	And they break into a jog.
4516	Houdini lies motionless on the ground near the climbing frame, with SOMEONE kneeling beside him.
4517	The barbecue fork sticks out of Houdini's throat.
4518	And SOMEONE holds an asthma inhaler as he stares down at the dog.
4519	SOMEONE looks up at his father through puffy red eyes.
4520	SOMEONE sits up on a platform on the climbing frame, with her knees drawn tightly up to her chin.
4521	She wears blue sneakers and jeans under her pale flowery dress.
4522	SOMEONE looks back down and takes a puff of his inhaler.
4523	SOMEONE stares at his son and crouches down beside Houdini.
4524	SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's hand and steps over Houdini.
4525	They gaze down at the dead dog.
4526	SOMEONE puts his hand on SOMEONE's shoulder.
4527	SOMEONE brushes it away and trudges off solemnly.
4528	SOMEONE steps up to the climbing frame and looks searchingly at SOMEONE.
4529	She remains in a tight ball, staring down at the ground.
4530	SOMEONE gently lifts her off the platform and holds her against his shoulder.
4531	He carries SOMEONE back to the farmhouse as SOMEONE emerges, carrying a bowl and a bag of feed.
4532	SOMEONE walks past him.
4533	SOMEONE climbs onto the veranda and walks through the front door of the house.
4534	SOMEONE looks over to the climbing frame with a confused expression.
4535	He is in his early 30s with short dark hair and a boyish face.
4536	SOMEONE puts down the bag of feed and unties Isabel, the other Alsatian, from the veranda steps.
4537	He leads her across the yard as SOMEONE pulls the barbecue fork from Houdini's throat.
4538	A wire wind chime in the shape of a beaming sun hangs on the veranda and swings mournfully in the soft breeze.
4539	That night the farmhouse stands in darkness beneath a black sky.
4540	SOMEONE lies on his side in bed.
4541	His eyes suddenly open.
4542	He stares ahead.
4543	SOMEONE gazes at him.
4544	SOMEONE pads across the landing to the children's bedroom, holding SOMEONE by the hand.
4545	They come to the open bedroom door and step into the darkened room, where SOMEONE lies half off his bed in an uncomfortable looking heap.
4546	SOMEONE shuffles off to her bed as SOMEONE gently lifts SOMEONE up and lies him on his back.
4547	SOMEONE walks across the bedroom and sits beside SOMEONE on her bed.
4548	He gazes at her and looks her up and down.
4549	SOMEONE looks at him through wide bright eyes.
4550	A sadness falls across SOMEONE's face.
4551	SOMEONE looks at his daughter, then, glances over at the bedroom window.
4552	A shadowing figure stands by a chimney pot on the barn roof.
4553	SOMEONE jumps to his feet.
4554	Downstairs in the lounge, SOMEONE's asleep in an armchair.
4555	SOMEONE touches his shoulder and SOMEONE wakes.
4556	He looks up at his brother in confusion.
4557	People are by the front door.
4558	SOMEONE opens the door.
4559	An outside light comes on.
4560	They rush out and split up.
4561	SOMEONE comes to the back of the house as a dust bin's tipped over up ahead.
4562	SOMEONE runs along the side of the house.
4563	The brothers meet up again at the front of the house.
4564	They stop and look around breathlessly.
4565	A sound on the roof of the house attracts their attention.
4566	SOMEONE keeps his gaze fixed firmly on the farmhouse roof as he paces backwards down the gloomy yard, and tries to get a better view.
4567	He walks tensely back to SOMEONE.
4568	People turn and look behind them as something brushes past the swing.
4569	There's an urgent rustling in the maize stalks beyond the swing, which gradually dies away.
4570	Next morning, SOMEONE sits in the dining room with SOMEONE, who's holding her walkie talkie.
4571	SOMEONE nods.
4572	SOMEONE smiles warmly and nods back.
4573	She grins.
4574	SOMEONE sits in the adjoining lounge, watching cartoons.
4575	SOMEONE walks over.
4576	SOMEONE does so.
4577	There are three glasses of water on the TV set.
4578	SOMEONE looks across at SOMEONE, who sits at the other end of the long dining room table.
4579	He rests his head on his hand and looks up at her.
4580	SOMEONE grins at SOMEONE and absently rubs his finger on the table top.
4581	She shrugs.
4582	SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, who's studying her walkie talkie.
4583	She looks back at SOMEONE.
4584	SOMEONE walks across the lounge and spots three glasses of water on a small table.
4585	He leans over and picks them up.
4586	He stands upright and sees some more glasses of water on a nearby cabinet.
4587	SOMEONE puts the three glasses back down and walks into the dining room.
4588	He sits at the table by SOMEONE.
4589	She checks her notebook.
4590	She gives them a patronizing look.
4591	SOMEONE looks tense and awkward.
4592	She nods.
4593	SOMEONE shrugs, and looks uncertainly at SOMEONE.
4594	SOMEONE blows out his cheeks.
4595	And SOMEONE looks at the ceiling.
4596	SOMEONE holds up his hands and turns away in frustration.
4597	SOMEONE comes into the dining room and taps SOMEONE on the arm.
4598	SOMEONE leaves.
4599	SOMEONE shifts awkwardly.
4600	SOMEONE considers for a moment.
4601	SOMEONE comes back.
4602	SOMEONE looks up.
4603	In the lounge, the TV shows news footage of a corn field with a line of crop circles similar to SOMEONE's.
4604	A man talks to camera.
4605	17 circles are scattered across a map of India.
4606	Footage shows people standing in some of the circles.
4607	SOMEONE's steely blue eyes gleam as he stares at the TV.
4608	SOMEONE takes a puff of his inhaler.
4609	SOMEONE stands behind him.
4610	People come out of the house.
4611	She shakes her head as they stroll away from the farmhouse.
4612	SOMEONE nods and opens the driver's door of her police car.
4613	She smiles and gets in.
4614	SOMEONE stands and watches as SOMEONE pulls around an island of grass in the middle of a stretch of gravel and heads off down the driveway.
4615	People sit in the back of a car.
4616	SOMEONE points a finger at SOMEONE.
4617	And he brushes it away.
4618	SOMEONE turns the radio off again.
4619	SOMEONE, in the driving seat, glances over his shoulder at SOMEONE, then, turns back to the road.
4620	SOMEONE sighs wearily.
4621	An aerial view looks directly down onto a quiet freeway, which runs through a suburban part of town.
4622	SOMEONE's silver station wagon drives along the freeway, and passes a large modern church.
4623	The station wagon parks up beside some other vehicles outside a parade of shops and the family get out.
4624	SOMEONE feeds the parking meter.
4625	And SOMEONE holds his hand out to SOMEONE.
4626	SOMEONE hands SOMEONE some cash.
4627	People head off down the sidewalk together.
4628	SOMEONE watches them as SOMEONE holds out his hand and SOMEONE takes it.
4629	SOMEONE turns and calls to SOMEONE, who strolls off in the other direction.
4630	SOMEONE's in a bookshop watching the news coverage with the middle aged proprietors.
4631	A radio's on in a pharmacy as SOMEONE waits at the counter.
4632	The young shop assistant comes to the counter with a paper prescription bag.
4633	She leans pensively on the counter.
4634	SOMEONE's face crumples.
4635	SOMEONE looks awkward.
4636	SOMEONE's in an army recruitment center looking at the posters.
4637	A gray haired man in a sergeant's uniform sits at a desk with a poster of SOMEONE behind him.
4638	SOMEONE turns to the sergeant.
4639	SOMEONE stares up at SOMEONE.
4640	SOMEONE gazes apprehensively down at SOMEONE, then laughs.
4641	He gives SOMEONE a pamphlet.
4642	SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE.
4643	SOMEONE nods.
4644	A scruffy young man's filling out a form.
4645	SOMEONE smirks.
4646	He has stubble on his chin and wears a t-shirt and sleeveless biker jacket.
4647	SOMEONE folds up the pamphlet and puts it in his pocket.
4648	SOMEONE walks solemnly towards the door.
4649	He stops just behind SOMEONE and jerks as though about to hit him.
4650	SOMEONE flinches.
4651	And SOMEONE leaves.
4652	In the bookshop, SOMEONE sits at a table and sips a glass of water.
4653	A cola commercial comes on TV.
4654	SOMEONE holds the book out to the lady.
4655	In the pharmacy.
4656	SOMEONE thinks.
4657	People are already eating in a pizza restaurant when SOMEONE comes in and sits at their table.
4658	The other three nod.
4659	SOMEONE sighs and nods back.
4660	Then, glances out of the restaurant doorway.
4661	His expression hardens when he sees a young dark-haired man of Asian descent strolling down the sidewalk, and opening the back door of a brown Chevrolet four by four.
4662	SOMEONE follows his father's gaze and looks out of the doorway at the man.
4663	SOMEONE also gazes out at the young man.
4664	SOMEONE and his family stare fixedly out at the young man, who shuts his car door and glances over at the restaurant.
4665	He sees the family gazing back at him.
4666	And his mouth opens in surprise.
4667	SOMEONE takes a deep breath.
4668	And the young man looks unsettled as he gets into his driver's seat, and fires up the engine.
4669	The four by four swings out of its parking bay, and accelerates off down the road.
4670	SOMEONE turns back to the table and takes a bite of pizza, while people continue looking out at the street.
4671	SOMEONE's station wagon returns to the farm, and pulls up outside SOMEONE's converted barn.
4672	People undo their seat belts, then, turn round to the buzzing noise coming from the back.
4673	SOMEONE picks up a pale blue radio receiver from beside him on the seat.
4674	SOMEONE sits next to SOMEONE in a child's car seat.
4675	She watches SOMEONE as he puts the receiver to his ear.
4676	He points to the sky.
4677	SOMEONE sighs and turns away.
4678	SOMEONE watches his brother, then, ponders and turns back to SOMEONE.
4679	SOMEONE reaches back.
4680	And SOMEONE gives him the receiver.
4681	People stare at each other and listen.
4682	SOMEONE sits back exasperated.
4683	SOMEONE gets out, followed by the rest of the family.
4684	SOMEONE freezes in shock.
4685	SOMEONE looks down at SOMEONE and considers.
4686	SOMEONE leans back down into the car.
4687	SOMEONE looks uneasy.
4688	SOMEONE slowly stands.
4689	SOMEONE reaches out his hand.
4690	People both hold the receiver across the car roof.
4691	SOMEONE climbs onto the roof of the car.
4692	He crawls towards people.
4693	And takes the receiver.
4694	SOMEONE runs round to the bonnet.
4695	SOMEONE clambers up.
4696	And SOMEONE sits on the bonnet to prevent her from getting any further.
4697	SOMEONE gets onto the roof with SOMEONE and holds him steady as SOMEONE points the receiver up to the sky.
4698	SOMEONE struggles to get onto the roof.
4699	And SOMEONE takes hold of her hand.
4700	SOMEONE slowly lowers the receiver and looks at it.
4701	SOMEONE slides back down into SOMEONE's lap.
4702	Carrying a metal dish of dog food for Isabel in one hand, SOMEONE steps out of the farmhouse through a screen door and into the dark.
4703	He walks steadily across the lawn to where the Alsatian is chained to its kennel.
4704	Agitated, Isabel shifts and jumps about, pulling at the chain, and barking into the quivering field of maize.
4705	SOMEONE stops just short of the dog and looks out into the darkened field.
4706	He slowly turns his body to face the crop.
4707	Isabel lunges at SOMEONE, who recoils.
4708	Staring in surprise at the dog, he turns his gaze back to the gently rustling field.
4709	Isabel remains agitated.
4710	SOMEONE opens a battered metal toolbox resting on a picnic bench.
4711	And lifts out a large torch.
4712	Inching cautiously forward and holding out his free hand as if for balance.
4713	He directs the circular torch beam onto the edge of the crop.
4714	SOMEONE walks slowly up to the wall of maize and steps inside the tall dense corn.
4715	He ventures on at an even pace, moving down a narrow channel between two rows of rigid stalks.
4716	The white torch light angled low illuminates the limp straggly green leaves, which bend back as he pushes through them.
4717	SOMEONE halts, raises the torch and peers into the tunnel of foliage ahead.
4718	He spins round, aiming the torch beam into the impenetrable jungle on one side, but finding nothing.
4719	The light hardly passing beyond the first few rows of woody green stalks.
4720	He then lowers the flashlight to his side and begins to pick his way through the crop, one arm raised to shield his face from the leaves.
4721	Emerging in the first of the crop circles, SOMEONE lowers his arm gently.
4722	And comes to a gradual stop, viewing the area with renewed concern.
4723	A pale gray light fills the vast perfect circle of evenly flattened corn.
4724	And the leaves glow with a silvery sheen.
4725	SOMEONE stands still, his torch shooting a slender shaft of light across the circle.
4726	His eyes dart about.
4727	SOMEONE swallows and takes a steadying breath.
4728	He scans the circle apprehensively, then, steps backwards towards the standing crop.
4729	Turning at the last moment, he cuts straight into the corn.
4730	Struggling through the unbending forest until he stumbles out onto a pathway running between two areas of maize.
4731	SOMEONE shines his torch along the path.
4732	It's clear.
4733	He then turns and points the beam the other way.
4734	Again, nothing.
4735	He stares into the crop.
4736	Whipping round, he drops the torch and the light goes out.
4737	Panting and keeping his eyes fixed intently on the maize.
4738	He crouches down warily and reaches for the torch.
4739	Locating the flashlight, he frantically slaps the lens.
4740	And the beam returns, briefly illuminating his face.
4741	He shines the light down the path.
4742	A long thin bare leg slips silently into the corn.
4743	SOMEONE scrabbles backwards.
4744	Then, leaps up and sprints off in the opposite direction.
4745	He plows into the corn and charges through it.
4746	The torch light dances over the leaves as he runs.
4747	In the farmhouse, people are washing up at the sink in the kitchen, which opens directly onto the lounge.
4748	SOMEONE sits at a table with his back to them.
4749	He reads the army pamphlet he picked up in town and lazily chews gum.
4750	Unnoticed by the other three, SOMEONE pads softly into the kitchen and stops.
4751	He lowers himself gently into a seat at the table.
4752	His two children turn around and see their father staring at the floor.
4753	SOMEONE steps falteringly up to the table, leaving SOMEONE at the sink.
4754	SOMEONE then peers casually over his shoulder and notices his downcast brother.
4755	Getting up, he heads into the kitchen, stopping just short of the table.
4756	SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE, then, sits up straight and sighs.
4757	On the screen, lights hover in a night sky.
4758	People sit on the sofa.
4759	People are kneeling close to the TV.
4760	SOMEONE fetches a video.
4761	SOMEONE stares wide-eyed at the screen.
4762	Now seated, SOMEONE uses his inhaler.
4763	He is beside SOMEONE.
4764	SOMEONE's at the other end of the sofa beside her dad.
4765	All four of them are hypnotized by the TV on which sit two glasses of water.
4766	Later, with the lights out, people are still transfixed.
4767	The children sleeping.
4768	He stares ahead.
4769	He meets SOMEONE's gaze.
4770	SOMEONE looks away.
4771	SOMEONE's smile fades.
4772	And SOMEONE looks somber.
4773	Uneasy, SOMEONE ponders this.
4774	Then, recalls something.
4775	And his face brightens a little.
4776	He grins.
4777	SOMEONE watches the TV.
4778	SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE, then, nods.
4779	SOMEONE shoots a knowing glance at this brother, who looking forlorn, returns his gaze to the TV.
4780	SOMEONE stares vacantly.
4781	His eyes meet with SOMEONE's.
4782	SOMEONE shakes his head.
4783	With conviction in his eyes, he stares piercingly at SOMEONE.
4784	He looks almost angry.
4785	His features taut and his eyes glistening, SOMEONE turns to face the TV.
4786	SOMEONE looks down thoughtfully.
4787	Then he too faces the TV.
4788	And they watch together.
4789	Their expressions blank as if in a trance.
4790	Now, a fresh-faced SOMEONE, dressed in black, and wearing a white dog collar, drives slowly down a country road at night.
4791	Ahead, the lights of emergency vehicles flash.
4792	And SOMEONE stands in the road, waving her arms above her head.
4793	His face long, SOMEONE pulls to a stop and climbs out.
4794	SOMEONE walks up to meet him.
4795	SOMEONE wakes up on the sofa.
4796	And his glazed eyes scan the room.
4797	Light floods through the windows into the comfortably furnished room.
4798	SOMEONE heaves himself into a sitting position.
4799	And stays there for a while without moving.
4800	He then spots a black cable snaking across the polished dark wood floor.
4801	Hoisting himself slowly to his feet, he follows the cable across the room and into the hallway.
4802	The lead runs into a closet under the stairs.
4803	And SOMEONE opens the door to find a bleary eyed SOMEONE sitting perfectly still, staring fixedly at the TV.
4804	He looks up, a little surprised.
4805	Uncomfortable, SOMEONE goes.
4806	The doors shut.
4807	Later, SOMEONE, wearing a blue dressing gown, pads out of the bathroom, drying his ear with a towel.
4808	Frowning, he goes to a window and looks down into the empty garden, with its swings, climbing frame and picnic bench.
4809	Hearing the voice, SOMEONE raises his eyebrows.
4810	Then, walks along the landing and into the children's room.
4811	People are sitting on a bed, wearing pointy cone shaped hats made of silver foil.
4812	They look up.
4813	SOMEONE's holding open a book.
4814	SOMEONE points to her hat.
4815	SOMEONE enters and sits down between his children on the bed.
4816	He peers down at SOMEONE's book.
4817	SOMEONE closes the book.
4818	SOMEONE points at it.
4819	And SOMEONE falters.
4820	Opening the book.
4821	SOMEONE looks uncertain.
4822	Nodding dubiously, SOMEONE takes the book from SOMEONE and starts to leaf through the pages.
4823	People look on.
4824	On one page is a simple sketch of an extraterrestrial with a teardrop shaped head and large catlike eyes.
4825	On another page is a picture of a bluey green alien with an angular jaw, and black almond shaped eyes.
4826	On a third page, a gloomy nighttime drawing of a UFO firing two red laser beams into a wooden farmhouse, which is on fire.
4827	Flames pouring from the upstairs windows.
4828	Lying on the lawn of the pictured house are three shadowy bodies, an adult and two children.
4829	People are staring at the picture.
4830	SOMEONE's eyes flick pensively from side-to-side.
4831	They all jump back.
4832	Taking the book, he leaves.
4833	And answers the phone on the landing.
4834	SOMEONE stands stock still.
4835	The telephone receiver still pressed to his ear.
4836	He glances down the landing into a room containing a dressmaker's dummy.
4837	Now clothed, SOMEONE plods downstairs.
4838	Takes a coat from the closet, where SOMEONE is still glued to the TV.
4839	Then, picks up some keys.
4840	SOMEONE's confused.
4841	From the bedroom, SOMEONE's looking at clouds through a telescope.
4842	SOMEONE stands beside him.
4843	SOMEONE Nods with a worried expression.
4844	She gives a slow deliberate nod.
4845	She hugs his arm.
4846	SOMEONE avoids eye contact.
4847	SOMEONE knocks at the house of Vet. SOMEONE.
4848	He opens the screen door.
4849	He peers through slats in the wooden door behind it, then, gingerly closes the screen.
4850	SOMEONE gently releases the handle.
4851	Stepping back from the door, his keen eye scanning from left to right.
4852	He turns and treads calmly along the wooden veranda surrounding the house.
4853	Reaching the closed window, he stops and looks through the glass into an office.
4854	The compact ruin is deserted, the solid dark wood desk clattered with papers.
4855	SOMEONE's gaze alights on a wooden chair lying upturned on the floor beside the lampshade.
4856	Its toppled vase on a small round table above, the naked bulb still glowing brightly.
4857	SOMEONE views the scene with restrained alarm.
4858	Then, backing away.
4859	He turns and spots the brown Chevy 4x4 parked on a short driveway, a figure the wheel.
4860	SOMEONE approaches the vehicle cautiously across a lawn, leaning over to get a view of its occupant.
4861	The passenger side window is lowered.
4862	SOMEONE puts both hands on the sill and leans in with an inquisitive frown.
4863	SOMEONE, the Asian man who stayed in town, sits with one hand clamped to the steering wheel, rocking nervously and staring numbly ahead.
4864	In the back are bundles of clothes which SOMEONE eyes questioningly.
4865	Returning his attention to the front, he notices a blood stain on SOMEONE's check shirt.
4866	SOMEONE is still staring ahead.
4867	He lowers his eyes then frowns.
4868	SOMEONE regards him closely.
4869	SOMEONE bows his head and reflects.
4870	His guilty eyes reluctant to confront SOMEONE's gaze.
4871	The slowly, he turns and takes a breath.
4872	His doleful eyes linger on SOMEONE, then, he starts the engine.
4873	SOMEONE sits back in his seat.
4874	SOMEONE stares.
4875	He peers earnestly at SOMEONE, whose eyes moistened a little as he fights with his emotions.
4876	His lips curled and features crumpled, he nods sufferingly.
4877	SOMEONE drops his gaze.
4878	SOMEONE turns to face SOMEONE's clapboard home.
4879	At the farmhouse, in the closet under the stairs, SOMEONE is still watching TV.
4880	His brow creased with worry and lips slightly apart.
4881	SOMEONE moves his chair right up to the television, and watches the cam coder footage of his hysterical young children inside the house.
4882	The kids gathered by French windows and point to the backyard, where tables laden with party food lie abandoned.
4883	The camera focuses on tall bench bushes at the back of the yard, then, returns to the interior.
4884	It follows the children as they swarm to another window.
4885	SOMEONE watches in frustration.
4886	A boy looks out on a narrow passageway.
4887	The camera focuses on the passage.
4888	A lanky dark ring with a human appearance steps across the passage, and out of view.
4889	SOMEONE recoils, cupping a hand to his face in shock as he backs away from the TV.
4890	The film is rewound.
4891	SOMEONE sits back down in front of the TV and watches mouth gaping as the picture freezes on the creature.
4892	The image flickers slightly.
4893	SOMEONE's into SOMEONE's house.
4894	Pausing outside the open kitchen door.
4895	He steps timidly into the room, where chairs lie turned on the floor and the tables being wedged against the door leading into the pantry.
4896	A shadow passes under the door as SOMEONE treads hesitantly towards it.
4897	The movement is then accompanied by a sound.
4898	SOMEONE stares intently at the gap under the door.
4899	The shadow under the pantry door stops moving.
4900	SOMEONE eyes the door anxiously, then, swallows.
4901	He nods to himself.
4902	He closes his eyes and mouths SOMEONE self charmingly.
4903	The shadow under the door remains still.
4904	SOMEONE glances briefly away from the door incredulous.
4905	Then, with his head turned wearily to one side, and ticked defensively back a little drops delicately to a kneeling position.
4906	Bends down and pressing his face to the tiles, peers under the pantry door.
4907	He finds nothing but shards of glass.
4908	Kneeling up again and sighing with relief.
4909	He spots some chopped vegetables sitting on a work top and lying next to them, a large kitchen knife.
4910	SOMEONE contemplates the knife for a moment the reaches out and grabs it.
4911	Holding the knife at belly level, he twists the long wide blade until he is looking at his own reflection in the polished steel.
4912	Glancing up, he reaches forward and positions the knife at a downward sloping angle at the base of the door.
4913	Turning the knife in different directions, cans, bottles, and boxes of food are reflected in the blade.
4914	SOMEONE withdraws the knife and puts it down on the floor beside him.
4915	Then frustrating himself on his belly, he makes to look under the door again.
4916	Having second thoughts, he grabs the knife and kneels up.
4917	Setting the knife back down on the worktop.
4918	He rises to his feet and head bowed strides determinedly out into the hallway.
4919	Stopping in his tracks, SOMEONE turns and marches back in, seizing the knife.
4920	He lies on his stomach by the pantry door.
4921	A clawed hand shoots out from under the door.
4922	Startled, SOMEONE bangs his head and drops the knife.
4923	Retrieving the knife, SOMEONE slices off the creature's fingers.
4924	Started, the flock of birds springs from the maize fields, scattering, and flying away.
4925	Later, SOMEONE returns to the farm house.
4926	Locking the door behind him, he hurriedly checks the handle, then, walks off past the open living room door.
4927	He stops dead and stares, seeing people and now SOMEONE on the sofa wearing silver foil cone hats.
4928	Without flinching, SOMEONE turns stiffly and goes to sit on the stairs.
4929	SOMEONE sits still with his hands on his knees.
4930	SOMEONE links his hands together.
4931	SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
4932	SOMEONE makes a pained frown.
4933	Putting one hand on the post at the bottom of the stairs, SOMEONE pulls himself wearily up and plods into the living room, moving up to the sofa.
4934	SOMEONE holds up one arm.
4935	SOMEONE does the same.
4936	People raise their arms.
4937	SOMEONE eyes them uncertainly.
4938	All three.
4939	People lower their arms, SOMEONE settles himself back down on the sofa.
4940	SOMEONE hesitates a moment then steps forward, and sits beside his son on the end of the couch.
4941	SOMEONE peers up at his father.
4942	SOMEONE stares blankly ahead.
4943	He sighs.
4944	Now, in broad daylight, SOMEONE leaves his converted barn holding a large white cotton sack.
4945	A cigarette in one hand, he jogs down the grey-painted wooden stairs on the side of the building then trudges across the lawn towards the farmhouse.
4946	As he takes a drag on the cigarette, his attention is drawn to the field of maize.
4947	SOMEONE throws the cigarette butt to the ground, then, slows to a gradual stop.
4948	Dumping the cotton sack, he reaches down, picks up a stone, and launches it into the field of maize.
4949	He stands immobile, watching the crop with anxious expectation.
4950	Behind him, shrubs growing outside the farmhouse are buffeted by the growing wind.
4951	SOMEONE eyes the crops suspiciously, then, retreats.
4952	He picks up the cotton sack, jogs up the steps to the farmhouse veranda and hits indoors.
4953	People are glued to the TV screen in the closet.
4954	People arrive.
4955	They stand and watch.
4956	SOMEONE looks uneasy.
4957	SOMEONE is deep in thought.
4958	The presenter shifts fearfully.
4959	Unflinching, SOMEONE stares directly at the television screen.
4960	Standing rooted to the floor, SOMEONE continues to scrutinize the images on the TV.
4961	His features sagging mournfully as he reflects on the presenter's words.
4962	He wanders off, leaving SOMEONE alone with people.
4963	The two children are mesmerized by the screen.
4964	SOMEONE kneels down on the floor beside them.
4965	Looking up at SOMEONE.
4966	Pale with worry, SOMEONE turns back to the TV.
4967	SOMEONE is now in the room.
4968	He moves to a window, which is being partially boarded up on the inside and peers out.
4969	He then takes a plank of old wood and secures it over the window, blocking out the light completely.
4970	Outside, the silver pipes of a wind chime knock against each other.
4971	Then, more chime are disturbed by the strengthening breeze.
4972	SOMEONE sits indoors in dim lights, staring and failing me ahead.
4973	SOMEONE sauces into the room and stops next to people, who are standing against a wall.
4974	SOMEONE nods.
4975	SOMEONE smiles.
4976	SOMEONE turns to look at his brother.
4977	SOMEONE beams.
4978	His lips spread into a smile.
4979	Later, in the dimly little kitchen, pans and bowls, one full of empty eggshells, are stacked up into two sinks.
4980	On a worktop lies a sharp knife along with a skinned onion, some potato peel on top of tomato.
4981	People and the two children sit silently at the dinner table in the next room.
4982	Shifting awkwardly in his chair, SOMEONE casts a fleeting glance at the others.
4983	SOMEONE's taken aback.
4984	SOMEONE's lips trembles slightly.
4985	SOMEONE's eyes are swollen.
4986	He reaches over and stabs his fork into a piece of molten toast, then, sits back down.
4987	SOMEONE watches in disbelief as SOMEONE tucks into his mount of food.
4988	SOMEONE sitting next to him in tears.
4989	Upset, SOMEONE winces as he eats.
4990	Observing him, SOMEONE gets up from his chair and goes to his dad who is now throwing down his fork and is sobbing uncontrollably.
4991	SOMEONE leans into his father who hugs him tightly, then, pulls SOMEONE to his other side.
4992	SOMEONE is staring self-consciously at his plate when SOMEONE's hand reaches out, and tucks him in the family embrace.
4993	SOMEONE's body rocks as he cries.
4994	At the other end of the table, the red lines on the baby monitor begin to flash.
4995	SOMEONE and his family look up and stare at.
4996	SOMEONE walks slowly across the polished wooden floor into the front hallway.
4997	Reaching the door to the cupboard under the stairs, pulls it open.
4998	He looks at the TV set inside.
4999	It's displaying a test card.
5000	He turns to look back at the others and swallows.
5001	Later, SOMEONE is upstairs, hammering boards the door to the children's bedroom.
5002	Across the landing in his room, SOMEONE cautiously approaches the window and looks out over the maize field.
5003	His eyes widening and becoming fixed in a fearful stare, he backs towards the bedroom door.
5004	SOMEONE looks over at him.
5005	Eyes still on the window, SOMEONE sidles out of the room and closes the door.
5006	SOMEONE lifts up a plank and hold across the door.
5007	SOMEONE taking the other end.
5008	Together, the two men hammered nails through the plank into the door frame.
5009	SOMEONE With SOMEONE standing at the top of the stairs behind them, watching.
5010	Turning to get another mail, SOMEONE stops and stares at SOMEONE before helping SOMEONE with another plank.
5011	SOMEONE remains motionless, clinging to her brother.
5012	SOMEONE walks over.
5013	He crouches down.
5014	She shakes her head.
5015	SOMEONE grins at him.
5016	He strokes her cheek.
5017	SOMEONE pulls her towards him.
5018	He picks his daughter up.
5019	SOMEONE slaps another plank across the bedroom door.
5020	SOMEONE in his arms, SOMEONE go downstairs into the front hallway.
5021	People put the children down.
5022	They stop and listen.
5023	They all stare in the direction of the barking beyond the wooden mantle piece which stands at the far end of the room.
5024	Two China dogs sitting on it, one on each side, illuminated by the dim glow of two wall lamps above them.
5025	SOMEONE's eyes dart nervously around.
5026	His fingers tightening on SOMEONE's shoulders in front of him.
5027	He and SOMEONE exchange anxious glances.
5028	They looked towards a boarded up window to the right of the mantle piece, their gaze passes across the fireplace as they turned to follow the noises.
5029	Shadows flit across the slit of moonlight between two planks across the window on the left of the mantle piece.
5030	Slowly, the family turns to watch the figures block out the soft light, diffusing through the gaps between the boards on another window at the front of the house.
5031	They swing around and stare petrified down the hallway and into the kitchen towards the backdoor.
5032	They turn quickly back around to look at the front door, one plank nailed across the frame halfway up.
5033	The doorknob turns.
5034	SOMEONE starts to back away.
5035	SOMEONE looks around and puts a comforting hand on SOMEONE's shoulder before kneeling down in front of the frightened boy.
5036	SOMEONE smiles lovingly as a tear falls from SOMEONE's eyes.
5037	SOMEONE stares wearily up the staircase, climbing the first two steps.
5038	He gazes in horror at the unsecured hatch door in the attic.
5039	People pulled the children down the hallway into the kitchen.
5040	SOMEONE's terrified eyes focused on the gap at the bottom of the front door as green gray fingers appear underneath it.
5041	SOMEONE hurries down some stairs into the gloomy basement and slams the door shut.
5042	SOMEONE turns suddenly and presses his ear against the door.
5043	His hands pushing against the door, its olive green paint peeling.
5044	SOMEONE looks down at the doorknob.
5045	He grabs it as it starts to turn and holds it tight with both hands, resting his head on the door.
5046	SOMEONE spots a pickaxe.
5047	As he yanks it off a high shelf, he smashes the light bulb, plunging the basement into darkness.
5048	SOMEONE turns on a torch and stares down into its bright beam before looking around and pointing it at the door.
5049	People pushing hard against it, the pickaxe now firmly waged under the doorknob.
5050	SOMEONE turns to put his back against the door.
5051	He shields his eyes from the bright torch beam.
5052	SOMEONE slowly directs the torch beam around the basement, and starts to walk past a cluttered work bench.
5053	The light falls on SOMEONE, crouched on the floor.
5054	She waves lamely at SOMEONE.
5055	SOMEONE finds another flashlight and directs its beam around the walls of the basement, illuminating old wooden shelves, supporting neatly-arranged pickling jars, bowls, ski boots, roller skates, and disordered clatter.
5056	He spots a dusty old radio on one shelf and tuns the dial on the front.
5057	They went around to face the door.
5058	SOMEONE pushes his hand against the door lit by SOMEONE's torch.
5059	He then turns to face the others.
5060	The pickaxe holds in place as the doors hit.
5061	SOMEONE stares thoughtfully at the door.
5062	SOMEONE sets the white-headed silver torch on the ground and rolls it across to his father.
5063	SOMEONE walks over to SOMEONE.
5064	People move slowly in different directions, working their way around the rough stone walls.
5065	A dry and faded flowery hangs on a hook.
5066	A wire-framed basket hangs on another peg.
5067	They come towards each other again.
5068	Their torch beams picking up the call shoot with roll turning grill across it and SOMEONE standing in front of it.
5069	People stand and stare at him, stunned.
5070	A clawed hand pokes through the grill and grabs SOMEONE's throat.
5071	SOMEONE drops his torch as he rushes to rescue his son.
5072	As he runs away from the call shoot, he kicks the torch which rolls around to pick out SOMEONE's legs, poking out from beneath her silky blue dress as she presses herself up against the wall.
5073	She walks over to the torch, picks it up, and shines it at SOMEONE, who's stacking crates and live sacks of dog food in front of the chute.
5074	He slides wearily down his barricade to the ground.
5075	Spotting a can of dog food on the floor, he picks it up and rising slightly, reaches up beside him to slap it on top of the pile of sacks.
5076	Sitting back down on the floor, he looks across at SOMEONE, and then, picks up his torch, using it to search the basement for the others.
5077	The beam illuminates his brother, sitting on the floor, leaning against a pillar.
5078	SOMEONE, sitting between SOMEONE's legs, his head pushed back into his father's chest.
5079	SOMEONE's eyes widened in alarm.
5080	SOMEONE has one hand on SOMEONE's chest, the other gripping his son's shoulder.
5081	SOMEONE stares at them wide-eyed.
5082	SOMEONE rests his head against SOMEONE's.
5083	SOMEONE goes to sit on SOMEONE's lap, tears welling in her eyes.
5084	SOMEONE holds the knees of his father's jeans tightly as he struggles with his breathing.
5085	SOMEONE lifts his head slightly and stares angrily into the distance.
5086	His lips quiver.
5087	SOMEONE wheels SOMEONE on, mouthing silent words of earnest prayer.
5088	SOMEONE relaxes his grip on his father's jeans.
5089	SOMEONE lies back, his breathing returning to normal.
5090	SOMEONE stares across at them, blinking rapidly.
5091	He swallows.
5092	He turns his off.
5093	SOMEONE turn hers off.
5094	In SOMEONE's mind, he reaches the scene of the accident.
5095	SOMEONE talks to him.
5096	He stares at the ground.
5097	His lips trembling.
5098	SOMEONE nods.
5099	She smiles bleakly.
5100	SOMEONE walks slowly past a police car and a huddle of policemen standing over SOMEONE who's sitting on the ground head bowed.
5101	A little way beyond is SOMEONE's Ford pickup truck smashed into the tree, stretched into any of the front and a couple of paramedics standing by.
5102	They turned to look at SOMEONE as he approaches.
5103	Back in the basement, the main light is on.
5104	SOMEONE looks up.
5105	SOMEONE walks over to the radio.
5106	SOMEONE stares blearily down at the floor.
5107	SOMEONE looks up at SOMEONE in shock.
5108	SOMEONE gets to his feet and takes a step towards his brother.
5109	SOMEONE looks reflectively down at the ground.
5110	SOMEONE regards him accusingly.
5111	SOMEONE frowns and shakes his head.
5112	SOMEONE steps towards him.
5113	SOMEONE nods numbly, his mouth agape.
5114	They turn to look at SOMEONE asleep on the floor, his head resting on folded blankets.
5115	SOMEONE glances at the door.
5116	Suddenly, thinking of something, SOMEONE walks over to SOMEONE, and crouching down, lifts up the back of the boy's beige and brown check shirt.
5117	SOMEONE glances up in relieved surprise.
5118	And pulls the baby monitor out of the back pocket of SOMEONE's jeans.
5119	He switches it on as SOMEONE kneels beside him.
5120	SOMEONE removes the pickaxe from under the doorknob and pulls open the door.
5121	Gingerly, he starts to climb the gloomy stairwell leading up into the kitchen, thick rays of sunlight pouring through irregular holes punched into the wooden planks across the window.
5122	In the basement, SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE tentatively reaches the top of the steps and looks around.
5123	SOMEONE turns left and disappears from SOMEONE's view.
5124	SOMEONE reappears, looks down the stairwell, and nods.
5125	SOMEONE carries SOMEONE slowly up the stairs and into the kitchen, where chairs are strewn across the floor, and the fridge door is open.
5126	SOMEONE follows her father and then wanders out into the hallway as SOMEONE carries SOMEONE through the dining room and into the living room, staring at the broken planks across the windows.
5127	A table lamp underneath one window is on its side.
5128	A picture hanging below a mounted baseball bat is askew, but otherwise the room is untouched.
5129	SOMEONE lays SOMEONE gently down on the sofa.
5130	SOMEONE comes back in.
5131	She does a little dance.
5132	She swings her arms and thrusts her hips.
5133	He looks down at SOMEONE.
5134	He heads to the cupboard under the stairs.
5135	SOMEONE unplugs the set and wields the TV trolley down the hallway into the living room.
5136	He maneuvers it into position and crouches down to plug it in.
5137	He stares in horror at the reflection on the screen, a tall humanoid form silhouetted against the window, holding SOMEONE across one of its arms.
5138	SOMEONE slowly stands and turns round to face the creature.
5139	SOMEONE comes in from the dining room and stops in his tracks, dropping the syringe.
5140	SOMEONE steps forward.
5141	The creature, with its highly domed head, stares between the two men.
5142	SOMEONE looks at the alien's lower arm, which is wrapped around SOMEONE's back and matches his shirt fabric.
5143	Two of the creatures four clawed digits are missing.
5144	SOMEONE remembers using the knife outside SOMEONE's pantry.
5145	The alien holds its other hand out over SOMEONE's face, tilting its hand up at the wrist joint.
5146	A sharp spike slides out of the bottom of the wrist.
5147	The alien holding it above SOMEONE's nose.
5148	People stand rooted to the spot, staring in abject horror as the alien looks down at SOMEONE and then up at SOMEONE.
5149	SOMEONE studies the creature with its smooth-skinned earless head, an odd shaped mouth, dull gray teeth exposed.
5150	He glares into the alien's hooded eyes as he remembers driving to the scene of the accident.
5151	SOMEONE in the road waving her arms.
5152	SOMEONE narrows his eyes slightly as he remembers crouching by the front of SOMEONE's pickup.
5153	His wife's head rests on the bonnet.
5154	He stares into her eyes and nods.
5155	SOMEONE's eyes fill with tears as he reaches out to take her hand in his.
5156	SOMEONE stares at her, puzzled, through his wet eyes.
5157	Her head lowers.
5158	SOMEONE remembers his conversation with SOMEONE.
5159	His eyes glazed with tears, SOMEONE stares at the alien as it rocks back and forth, leaning over its captive hanging limply over its arm.
5160	SOMEONE turns slowly from the creature to face SOMEONE, spotting the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his brother.
5161	He turns back around to stare with stern determination at the alien.
5162	SOMEONE remains motionless.
5163	SOMEONE turns his gaze from the creature to SOMEONE.
5164	And then looks behind him to the bat.
5165	The alien watches him.
5166	Its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets.
5167	SOMEONE takes the bat down.
5168	The alien lowers its hand over SOMEONE's face.
5169	A gray gash shooting from the spike and into SOMEONE's nose.
5170	The alien turns.
5171	SOMEONE launches himself at the creature, striking it in the back.
5172	The alien drops SOMEONE.
5173	And turns back to face his assailant.
5174	SOMEONE rushes over to pick up SOMEONE and the dropped syringe.
5175	SOMEONE strikes the creature in its abdomen.
5176	It falls into a side table, knocking over a glass of water.
5177	As the water spills onto its shoulder, an angry red wound erupts in its green gray skin.
5178	People stare around the room at the collection of discarded glasses of water.
5179	SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE in astonishment.
5180	And then hurries outside with SOMEONE in his arms.
5181	SOMEONE following him.
5182	On the veranda, SOMEONE looks back into the living room through a broken window as SOMEONE heads out onto the lawn.
5183	SOMEONE swings the bat at glasses on the coffee table.
5184	The alien recoils as its skin is splashed with liquid.
5185	Crouched on the lawn, SOMEONE, holding his son across his thighs, adjusts the syringe.
5186	And then, thrusts it into SOMEONE's leg.
5187	SOMEONE prepares for another strike.
5188	He slams the bat into the alien.
5189	The creature topples over, landing on his back and knocking against a small sideboard.
5190	Glasses on the sideboard tip over.
5191	Water cascading down onto the crib.
5192	The broken head of the bat lies on the floor, shards of glass around it.
5193	The alien takes deep, difficult breaths.
5194	The alien's chest sinks and fails to rise.
5195	SOMEONE hurries out into the garden and crouches down by people.
5196	SOMEONE, his eyes closed, cradles his limp son.
5197	SOMEONE presses SOMEONE's neck and recoils.
5198	SOMEONE turns away.
5199	SOMEONE's face creases as she begins to sob.
5200	SOMEONE opens his moistened eyes.
5201	His face shudders.
5202	SOMEONE swings round.
5203	SOMEONE looks on in awe.
5204	SOMEONE turns.
5205	Hardly daring to look at his son as SOMEONE lifts his head.
5206	SOMEONE wipes his eyes.
5207	SOMEONE's bedroom window looks out over the scene.
5208	The family huddled together on the grass near the picnic table and brick barbecue.
5209	Early morning sunshine floods the lawn.
5210	And the expanse of gently waving maize plants beyond.
5211	Below the light catches the sharp edges of the broken window pane.
5212	The light brown curtains flap in the breeze like loosened sails.
5213	The board across another window in the room remain intact.
5214	And large flakes of fresh white snow drift down outside the repaired windows of the room.
5215	The bed is neatly made.
5216	A blue bedspread with white polka dots smoothed across it.
5217	White pillow plumped up against the barred metal headboard.
5218	The door to the on suite bathroom is ajar.
5219	SOMEONE comes out of the bathroom dressed in black trousers and shirt, a white clerical collar around his neck.
5220	He pulls the bathroom door closed, does up his shirt cuff buttons and puts on his watch.
5221	And picking up a black jacket, he goes out, a look of contentment and purpose on his face.
5222	Dark clouds cover half of the bright moon.
5223	A figure hurtles dying towards the ground.
5224	Long, bony fingers caress the street as the black-tied figure rises to its feet.
5225	The figure is a slight man in his 30's, blood streaks the right side of his face.
5226	He has blond cropped hair and a thick color.
5227	He stares at lights in the sky which go out.
5228	Rain falls.
5229	He throws himself against the wall and huddles beside it.
5230	He holds out a broad-bladed dagger and points it in the direction of the dog which barks from behind the wire fence.
5231	The man rips open his black top, revealing a thin, toned body with tattoos and blood in line with the streak on his face.
5232	He walks towards the dog in its pound, raises the dagger above his head and brings it down with great force.
5233	Bright light shines on him and a blue light ring falls over his and opens the collar around his neck.
5234	It falls to the ground.
5235	Rain washes blood across the ground and into a drain.
5236	Inside the building, a man in a suit and carrying a torch walks along between stacking shelf, some covered with cellophane.
5237	Under a skylight, he steps on a toy.
5238	He bends down and picks it up.
5239	The man in the black coat jumps through the skylight onto him.
5240	Knocking him and his torch to the floor.
5241	The man from the sky goes to a grubby men's room.
5242	Removes his coat and opens a first aid box.
5243	He uses a thread and a bent needle to stitch a nasty wound on his back.
5244	Flesh has been torn away at shoulder level.
5245	He watches his reflection in a mirror as he sows.
5246	His bloody hand grasps the sinks, as his blood drips on the floor.
5247	Now dressed, he marches to a door and removes a chain.
5248	He switches on lights in an armory.
5249	Dressed in black, shirt, trousers and light coat.
5250	He picks up two assault rifles with grenade launchers.
5251	Then a selection of assault and sniper rifles.
5252	He walks out of the armory with two bags in his hands.
5253	He reaches a door with a metal bar across it.
5254	Two cops, people, drive along a downtown street.
5255	The burlier of the two, SOMEONE, glances out as they pass people on the sidewalk.
5256	SOMEONE holds up his fingers in the shape of a gun.
5257	A door explodes just in front of them.
5258	And a man is hurled into the air.
5259	A hole in the shape of a cross has been made in the building.
5260	And they watch, as the man from the sky, steps into the flaming surround.
5261	SOMEONE gets out and draws his gun.
5262	The man talks to SOMEONE.
5263	He drops them.
5264	He stares at the cops and complies.
5265	SOMEONE steps up to cuff him, and is spun around as a shield.
5266	SOMEONE convulses.
5267	SOMEONE dances on the spot as they shake.
5268	Light flicker.
5269	His eyes are staring, and his face tight.
5270	SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE.
5271	SOMEONE leaps to the ground, moves over and shoots SOMEONE with two hand guns.
5272	SOMEONE places his two guns in the bags and takes them to the police car.
5273	He drives off in it.
5274	SOMEONE's body lies on the sidewalk.
5275	The squad car identified by the number 1127 on it's roof drives past buildings.
5276	Lights shutting off in them, as he passes.
5277	A guy in his late 20s wakes and sits up with a start.
5278	He looks around and switches on a light.
5279	He is on a chair.
5280	A small television is to his left.
5281	He comes out of a two door trailer and shuts the door.
5282	In the early morning light he walks away from the big gray trailer.
5283	Passing under two strings of light bulbs.
5284	His hands as stuffed in his jacket pockets.
5285	The green neon lights of the sign illuminate his features.
5286	SOMEONE turns back to the trailer.
5287	She is pregnant.
5288	They sit on the swings facing in opposite directions.
5289	SOMEONE's belly is very swollen.
5290	SOMEONE wears a hang dog expression.
5291	He nods.
5292	She stares at him out of the corner of her eyes.
5293	Then looks away.
5294	She rises from the swing.
5295	Walks behind him, resting her hand momentarily on his shoulder.
5296	Before continuing on her way back to the trailer.
5297	He remains on the swing and doesn't move.
5298	She goes back inside through the second door.
5299	SOMEONE's father, SOMEONE, keeps thumping the TV set inside the Paradise Falls diner and plays with a lighter.

5301	He has a hook for a left hand.
5302	A skimpily dressed young woman leans over a juke box.

5306	SOMEONE turns, as does SOMEONE.
5307	SOMEONE turns to wife SOMEONE.
5308	A guy in an SUV drives along a deserted freeway, a half smoked cigarette in his mouth.
5309	He wears a brown beanie hat, a scarf around his neck, and a casual jacket.
5310	It's a sunny morning.
5311	He stubs out his cigarette and picks up his cellphone.
5312	He looks at it.
5313	He sees a sign for Paradise Falls, beneath it.
5314	He unfolds a map and lifts it up to study it.
5315	He lowers it and sees the diner up ahead.
5316	He pulls up in the forecourt and sees SOMEONE standing by a phone box, smoking a cigarette.
5317	He saunters up to her.
5318	She takes another drag on her cigarette.
5319	SOMEONE grins, reaches in her overall pocket, and takes out a pack.

5363	An old white Ford Sedan turns off the road and heads towards the petrol pumps.
5364	It passes them and draws to a halt outside the diner.

5366	The wheels and stanchions of a Zimmer frame are plunked on the rocky ground.

5973	Lines of men standing in the dry dock tug on heavy ropes attached to the ship.
5974	The sea crashing into the dry dock means the men in the center are waist-high in water.
5975	There are others at higher levels in the dock.
5976	The men are scruffy, unshaven, and are all prisoners.

5988	He squats and raises one end onto his shoulder.
5989	He then struggles to his feet.
5990	Grimacing, he lumbers forward as SOMEONE watches, coldly.
5991	The flag, still attached to the pole, is dragged through the water.
5992	The prisoner reaches SOMEONE and drops the pole.
5993	SOMEONE's eyes are fixed on SOMEONE, who staggers away from the dry dock.
5994	On a mountain top, he uses a stout staff as he plods across rocky terrain towards a cross on the summit.
5995	He passes the cross and looks ahead as the sun begins to rise.
5996	He walks up a snow-covered hillside, a lonely figure silhouetted against the skyline.
5997	A satchel over his shoulder, he steps onto a ledge and glances at the mountains ahead.
5998	Seeing men at work, he stops by a farmer.
5999	The farmer reads them, as SOMEONE removes his woolen hat.

6012	Now on his feet, he watches as one of the women places silverware in a cupboard.
6013	Lying in a bed, he stares up at an ornate ceiling.
6014	Then goes to the cupboard.
6015	As bishop sleeps, SOMEONE stuffs silverware into his satchel.
6016	He drops a tray.
6017	He picks it up as he runs from the church.
6018	SOMEONE is brought back to the church.

6020	He brings over two candlesticks and hands them to SOMEONE.
6021	The bishop places his hand on SOMEONE's head.
6022	A tomb with carvings of two Christified figures.
6023	Beside it, SOMEONE kneels at the altar.
6024	His papers in his hand.
6025	Blood stains his temple where he was hit.
6026	Having walked away From the altar, he returns and sinks to his knees.
6027	SOMEONE strides out of the church ripping his papers to shreds as he goes to the far corner of the church yard.
6028	He throws the pieces into the air.
6029	The church in the walled village sits on the top of a hill.
6030	One piece of paper flies high in the air towards the sun.
6031	SOMEONE in uniform rides in the rain ahead of four other uniformed horsemen.

6520	A disheveled old man lights the gas and puts on a kettle.
6521	He takes the top off a tea pot, and picks up a tea bag.
6522	Through the kitchen window, he notices a light in the big house.
6523	He throws down the tea bag angrily.
6524	He takes a bunch of keys from a hook, and leaves the cottage, lighting his way, with a large torch.
6525	He stumbles across the uneven ground, towards the big house.
6526	He hauls himself, unsteadily up the stone steps to the large wooden door.
6527	Inside the house, the strong beam of the old man's torch flickers over dusty wooden paneling and a grandfather clock festooned with cobwebs.
6528	Grasping the wooden banister, he starts to climb the un-carpeted stairs, his torch casting eerie shadows over the paneled walls.
6529	He turns off his torch, as he hears voices from an open doorway.
6530	The snake appears and slithers through the doorway towards a figure hidden in an armchair.
6531	The old man is engulfed in a flash of green light.
6532	In the cottage, the kettle boils.
6533	SOMEONE jerks awake.
6534	SOMEONE flops back onto his pillow.
6535	SOMEONE leads his group through a wood.
6536	A boy drops down.
6537	They climb a grassy slope.
6538	The faint glow of dawn appears in the sky.
6539	They all touch the boot which begins to spin like a Catherine wheel.
6540	They are pulled with it, spinning faster and faster, into a bright light.
6541	People, and the twins let go, and land heavily.
6542	SOMEONE looks up and sees people hiking sedately down to Earth.
6543	SOMEONE helps SOMEONE up.
6544	They follow the others, along a cliff top, overlooking the sea.
6545	The sun rises, as they look down on a gigantic campsite.
6546	Jugglers entertain the crowd, as even more tents are erected.
6547	People on broomsticks, fly dangerously low.
6548	SOMEONE leads them to a shabby two-man tent.
6549	SOMEONE gawks.
6550	Inside the tiny tent, he sees a vast interior furnished with carpets, beds, and sofas.
6551	SOMEONE smiles.
6552	As evening falls, they join the excited crowds in the magnificent Quidditch stadium.
6553	The spectators take their seats in the stands, many of them wearing colorful national costumes.
6554	He stops SOMEONE with his walking stick.
6555	He smacks at SOMEONE.
6556	Spotlight beams illuminate the packed stands.
6557	SOMEONE and the twins wear green and white scarves.
6558	SOMEONE takes them to the highest level of the stadium.
6559	The seven Irish players zoom out in formation.
6560	Green and white smoke streaming from their broomsticks.
6561	Fireworks explode in the shape of a spiritedly Leprechaun dancing a jig.
6562	The opposing team in black and red fly high above the pitch.
6563	One turns a somersault.
6564	A gigantic image of the handsome Bulgarian player is projected on to the towering stands.
6565	He hovers in front of a waving flag proclaming the name SOMEONE.
6566	SOMEONE raises his fist confidently.
6567	SOMEONE uses his wand to amplify his voice.
6568	A bright ball of light springs from his wand, and plunges down towards the arena.
6569	Back in the tent, SOMEONE and friends celebrate the Irish victory.
6570	SOMEONE lights a lamp.
6571	SOMEONE hurries them out of the tent.
6572	The camp is in chaos.
6573	Many of the tents are on fire.
6574	The flames leaping high into the darkness.
6575	SOMEONE sees ominous cloaked figures with skeleton masks and tall pointed hats, carrying flaming torches.
6576	He starts to run.
6577	Wrestled away from SOMEONE and the others, SOMEONE dodges through the panicking crowd.
6578	In the confusion, SOMEONE trips and falls.
6579	As he struggles to get up, flying feet knock him aside.
6580	Light from the burning tents flickers across his face, as he lies unconscious on the muddy ground.
6581	Everything goes black.
6582	A full moon shines down on the devastated camp.
6583	A lone figure strides between the smoking tents, kicking the smoldering remains.
6584	The figure points a wand into the dark sky and casts a spell.
6585	A huge, ghostly, green skull appears, with a snake emerging from its mouth.
6586	It floats above his head.
6587	The young man bears his teeth with an evil smile of satisfaction.
6588	SOMEONE slowly regains consciousness and sits up.
6589	He sees the shadowy figure approaching through the smoke.
6590	SOMEONE gets to his feet and runs away from the dark figure.
6591	The figure runs off.
6592	Seeing the skull, SOMEONE clutches his scar.
6593	A group of ministry wizards.
6594	They gaze up nervously at the ghostly skull, a dark mark still hovering above their heads.
6595	SOMEONE counts his money.
6596	SOMEONE nods to a young Chinese girl.
6597	She gives him a shy smile.

6599	SOMEONE leans forward.
6600	SOMEONE addresses an envelope to his godfather, SOMEONE.
6601	He puts the letter in to SOMEONE's beak.
6602	The snowy owl flies out of the train window, and sows away over a lake, as the Express steams on towards Hogwarts.
6603	Through a bright gap in the clouds, a huge coach appears, drawn by seven winged white horses.
6604	Students crowd into the school cloisters and gaze up in excitement as it swoops down towards them.
6605	SOMEONE guides the horses into land.
6606	He dives for cover as the coach flies low over his head.
6607	A tall mast flying a slender pennant emerges from the center of the lake.
6608	A huge, golden galleon rises majestically to the surface, water spilling from its decks.
6609	Huge sails are unfold, and the great ship glides smoothly towards the school.
6610	Gasping for breath, SOMEONE, the caretaker, runs down the hall and whispers to SOMEONE.
6611	SOMEONE runs out again.
6612	A troop of elegant girls glide into the hall, dancing.
6613	Their blue silk uniforms flatter their slim figures.

6620	SOMEONE smiles graciously, her face framed by a huge fur collar.
6621	She extends her hand.
6622	SOMEONE reaches up and kisses it.
6623	The Durmstrang students stride dramatically into the hall, wearing Slavic, military-style uniforms.
6624	Each carries a long staff.
6625	Sparks fly as they spin them round and strike the stone floor.
6626	Two of them hurtle forward, somersaulting high into the air.
6627	A handsome student with close-cropped hair strides past.
6628	SOMEONE recognizes his Quidditch hero.
6629	A student blows a ring of fire.
6630	Wearing a long, white coat and a Russian hat, High Master SOMEONE greets SOMEONE.
6631	A storm rages around Hogwarts.
6632	A dark, disheveled figure limps through the rain towards the school.
6633	SOMEONE has accidentally stabbed SOMEONE's hand.
6634	SOMEONE steps forward.
6635	As SOMEONE rises, a figure limps into the hall.
6636	Lightning flashes from the enchanted ceiling.
6637	The figure raises his wand, and the lightning retreats.
6638	SOMEONE recognizes him.
6639	SOMEONE has a scarred face and a large, protruding false eye fixed to another eye patch.
6640	It swivels erratically and lingers on SOMEONE.
6641	One of SOMEONE's feet is encased in a metal boot.
6642	SOMEONE takes a swig from a hip flask.
6643	SOMEONE nervously addresses the students.
6644	SOMEONE raises his hand towards an ornate, jeweled cabinet.
6645	The cabinet dissolves, revealing an ancient stone goblet.
6646	A bright blue flame leaps from its wide mouth.
6647	The flame continues to burn.
6648	The Durmstrang galleon strains at its moorings.
6649	The blue flame flickers eerily in the great hall.
6650	SOMEONE enters cautiously and carefully closes the door behind him.
6651	SOMEONE writes on the blackboard.
6652	He advances.
6653	SOMEONE looks petrified.
6654	SOMEONE looks apprehensive.
6655	SOMEONE takes a lid from a glass jar.
6656	He scoops out a spider.
6657	He produces his wand.
6658	The spider grows bigger.
6659	It lands on a desk, then on a boy's head.
6660	It crawls up a girl's arm.
6661	SOMEONE flicks his wand.
6662	The spider hovers over SOMEONE.
6663	It drops into SOMEONE's hair.
6664	The spider clamps itself on SOMEONE's face.
6665	It hits the glass.

6675	SOMEONE's eyes are tight shut.
6676	His face is clammy.
6677	SOMEONE places the spider in front of SOMEONE.
6678	She shakes her head.
6679	A flash of green light.
6680	The spider dies.
6681	His mad eye swivels round to stare down at SOMEONE, who looks up at him warily.
6682	SOMEONE nervously licks his lips and takes a swig from his hip flask.
6683	SOMEONE regards him thoughtfully.
6684	Leaving the classroom, SOMEONE follows people down a circular stone staircase.
6685	SOMEONE appears as they spot a sad figure.
6686	SOMEONE reluctantly follows SOMEONE back up the stairs.
6687	The rain runs like tears down the face of a woman in a stained-glass window.
6688	Students splash across the courtyard with cloaks over their heads to protect themselves from the rain.
6689	The goblet of fire stands in the great hall.
6690	Eligible students cross the circle of light drawn around it on the floor, reach up, and place their name into the blue flame.
6691	SOMEONE's supporters push him forward.
6692	He steps through the circle and puts his name into the stone goblet.
6693	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE an encouraging wave.
6694	People run into the hall in triumph.
6695	They each swallow the contents of a test tube and jump inside the circle.
6696	They put their names into the goblet.
6697	Engulfed in blue flames, people are flung out of the circle.
6698	They both have white hair and long, white beards.
6699	They grapple with each other, rolling over and over on the stone floor.
6700	SOMEONE shakes her head, sits on the stone steps, and opens a book.
6701	Accompanied by a Durmstrang student and their teacher, SOMEONE, SOMEONE approaches the circle.
6702	With a serious look on his face, he strides forward confidently and puts his name into to goblet.
6703	As he turns away, he catches SOMEONE's eye.
6704	She gives him a faint, admiring smile.
6705	The students assemble excitedly in the great hall.
6706	SOMEONE raises his hand.
6707	The flames of the burning torches around the hall gradually die down one by one.
6708	Everyone looks expectant.
6709	Arm outstretched, SOMEONE approaches the goblet of fire.
6710	The blue flame turns red.
6711	A piece of charred parchment flutters down into his hand.
6712	SOMEONE reads the name written on it.
6713	SOMEONE punches the air.
6714	His friends congratulate him.
6715	He rises from his seat and shakes SOMEONE by the hand.
6716	He leaves the hall.
6717	The flame flares again.
6718	SOMEONE reads a second piece of smoldering parchment.
6719	Beaming with pleasure, SOMEONE shakes SOMEONE's hand and follows SOMEONE.

6730	SOMEONE shakes his head.
6731	SOMEONE forces SOMEONE to his feet.
6732	SOMEONE glowers as SOMEONE walks hesitantly towards SOMEONE.
6733	The piece of parchment is still smoking at the edges.

6742	SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE.
6743	Every eye in the room is focused on SOMEONE.

6761	In a tiny room, a green quill hovers over a notebook.
6762	SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE inside.
6763	The quill writes.
6764	She winks at him.
6765	SOMEONE gestures to the quill.
6766	A small black owl swoops over Hogwarts School.
6767	It heads towards a tall, isolated tower.
6768	SOMEONE is waiting in the owlery as the black owl flies in through the window.
6769	He takes the note from its beak, unfolds it eagerly, and reads.
6770	SOMEONE sucks his pecked finger.
6771	On Saturday night, he hurries down into the Gryffindor common room.
6772	The room is deserted.
6773	He starts to read.
6774	Turning the page, he finds SOMEONE's article.
6775	He crumples up the newspaper and throws it into the fireplace.
6776	Sparks fly out of the fire.
6777	The image of a face forces itself through the glowing embers.
6778	SOMEONE looks nervously over his shoulder as he hears the sounds of a door.
6779	A shadow moves on the stairs.
6780	SOMEONE appears in his pajamas.
6781	SOMEONE turns and goes back up the stairs.
6782	SOMEONE looks into the embers again, but serious his face has gone.

6799	He hurries forward.
6800	SOMEONE puts on the invisibility cloak and disappears instantly.

6822	SOMEONE pulls a face behind her back.
6823	SOMEONE follows him.
6824	SOMEONE opens the door to his cluttered room.
6825	He hobbles painfully towards a chair and sits down.
6826	To SOMEONE's surprise, he unfastens his artificial metal leg and places it on a stand.
6827	He leans back in his chair.
6828	SOMEONE stares at a cloudy mirror.
6829	SOMEONE kicks a stool towards him.
6830	SOMEONE looks blank.
6831	In a wooden arena on a craggy hillside, people take bets from their fellow students.
6832	The Triwizard competitors pace restlessly in their tent as SOMEONE announces the contest.
6833	SOMEONE goes to a gap in the tent.
6834	She bursts in and throws her arms around his neck.
6835	SOMEONE and her photographer.
6836	SOMEONE looks SOMEONE up and down.
6837	She strokes his cheek with her quill.

6843	SOMEONE fires the cannon by mistake.
6844	SOMEONE swallows hard and takes a deep breath.
6845	In the competitors' tent, SOMEONE sits alone in nervous trepidation.
6846	SOMEONE walks out into a circular arena hewn from the rocky hillside and surrounded by a stone wall.
6847	High in the wooden terraces, people stand amongst the cheering spectators.
6848	SOMEONE resembles a gladiator in a Roman Arena.
6849	He glances around cautiously.
6850	SOMEONE moves towards a gleaming golden egg standing amongst the gray rocks.
6851	He has knocked off his feet by the force of the dragon's tail.
6852	The dragon's massive head and body are covered with sharp, lethal spikes.
6853	It blasts flame.
6854	SOMEONE leaps for safety up a high rock.
6855	The tethered dragon flies to the end of its long chain.
6856	It lashes out angrily, giving SOMEONE a vicious blow with its tail.
6857	He is flung onto the rocks below.
6858	The Hungarian Horntail flaps its huge leathery wings.
6859	SOMEONE scrambles to his feet.
6860	He dodges another burst of flame.
6861	The crowd flinches.
6862	SOMEONE laughs.
6863	As the dragon flaps towards him, SOMEONE climbs out of range.
6864	It lunges after him, baring its teeth.
6865	Taking a shelter behind a huge rock, SOMEONE sees his trusty broomstick zooming towards him.
6866	The dragon belches out another burst of flame.
6867	SOMEONE leaves the rock, leaps away from the dragon, and jumps onto his Firebolt as it swoops down into the arena.
6868	SOMEONE's friends cheer him on.
6869	The angry dragon stretches out its neck, breaking the chain.
6870	The creature flies free.
6871	Followed by the furious dragon, SOMEONE zooms around the arena.
6872	He bursts out through the stands over the heads of the startled onlookers, wings tearing through the canopy, scattering professors.
6873	They scramble to their feet.
6874	SOMEONE straightens her spectacles.
6875	Pursued by the dragon, SOMEONE flies over the valley towards the school.
6876	He narrowly avoids colliding with a tall stone tower.
6877	The dragon launches after him, as SOMEONE swoops low of the Hogwards.
6878	A faint mist is rising.
6879	As he flies, SOMEONE checks over his shoulder.
6880	But the dragon is nowhere to be seen.
6881	As SOMEONE rounds one of the towers, the dragon appears and knocks him off his broomstick.
6882	SOMEONE falls onto a stiff roof and hurtles downwards.
6883	He stops his fall by grabbing desperately onto a narrow parapet.
6884	The dragon settles on a nearby turret.
6885	SOMEONE dangles from the parapet, his gloved hands clutching a spiked pinnacle.
6886	He sees his broomstick far below.
6887	The dragon scrabbles across the turret onto the roof above SOMEONE.
6888	The pinnacle snaps.
6889	SOMEONE plunges down onto a windowsill.
6890	He hangs on desperately as the sill collapses under him.
6891	Dislodging tiles, the dragon claws its way across the roof towards him like a colossal bat.
6892	SOMEONE scrambles up and reaches high above his head for a broomstick.
6893	The dragon gets closer and closer.
6894	The Firebolt is stuck fast.
6895	SOMEONE frees the broomstick as the dragon lashes out, smashing the window to pieces.
6896	SOMEONE falls from a great height, pursued by the Horntail.
6897	He reappears out of the mist once again astride, his broomstick.
6898	A dreagon's close behind.
6899	A burst of flame sets the end of SOMEONE's broomstick on fire.
6900	It continues to smolder as the dragon zooms after SOMEONE through a stone arch.
6901	Ahead is the massive viaduct.
6902	SOMEONE flies towards it and hurtles through one of the narrow openings at the top.
6903	As the dragon tries to bat, its huge wings smash into the brickwork.
6904	SOMEONE and the Horntail plunge into the valley far below.
6905	The crowd of spectators in the arena scan the sky with nervous anticipation.
6906	SOMEONE and Fudge look very concerned.
6907	SOMEONE shields his eyes as he looks up into the empty sky.
6908	A tiny speck appears in the distance.
6909	SOMEONE screams.
6910	SOMEONE hovers for a moment, then aims the Firebolt down towards the gleaming golden egg, and triumphantly snatches it up.
6911	In a packed Griffindor common room the painted characters in the pictures join in the applause.
6912	The twins hoist SOMEONE onto their shoulders.
6913	The egg glows as SOMEONE twists it open.
6914	They clap their hands over their ears.
6915	SOMEONE appears in the doorway.
6916	SOMEONE closes the egg.
6917	SOMEONE faces SOMEONE awkwardly.
6918	The twins usher everyone away.
6919	SOMEONE shakes her head, bemused.
6920	Gray clouds are reflected in the waters of the lake.
6921	Owls fly in and out of the great hall.
6922	People walk together down the length of the hall.
6923	They pass the table where SOMEONE and his friends are eating breakfast.
6924	SOMEONE sees SOMEONE at the next table.
6925	As her friend points him out, SOMEONE smiles.
6926	Embarrassed, SOMEONE dribbles his drink.
6927	SOMEONE reads the paper.
6928	The small boy lingers at SOMEONE's elbow.
6929	SOMEONE looks curious.
6930	He unpacks a strange brown garment and holds it up.
6931	White frills.
6932	The twins try it.
6933	SOMEONE gets up reluctantly, his shirt hanging out.
6934	SOMEONE starts the gramophone.
6935	The twins grin.
6936	The girls get up enthusiastically.
6937	But none of the boys moves.
6938	Then SOMEONE stands up.
6939	Later, people find SOMEONE waltzing by himself around the bedroom, wearing his pajamas and a pair of shiny dancing shoes.
6940	People approach SOMEONE and her friends.
6941	The boys grin inanely, then move on hurriedly.
6942	He smiles at a group of Beauxbatons girls who stalk off.
6943	People.
6944	SOMEONE reaches down to pick something from SOMEONE's beard.
6945	She pops it in her mouth and licks her fingers seductively.
6946	People sit beside the lake.
6947	SOMEONE strides past wearing a singlet, followed by a group of giggling girls.
6948	SOMEONE looks flustered.
6949	In class, SOMEONE whispers to SOMEONE.
6950	SOMEONE clips his ear.
6951	SOMEONE passes SOMEONE a note.
6952	SOMEONE throws the crumpled note at Angelina.
6953	He points to her, mimes dancing, then points to himself.
6954	Angelina gives him a thumbs up.
6955	SOMEONE winks at SOMEONE.
6956	SOMEONE swipes people with a book.
6957	She gets up, hands her book to SOMEONE, and returns.
6958	She stalks off.
6959	SOMEONE hits them again.
6960	A blanket of snow lies over Hogwarts.
6961	Hands pushed deep inside his pockets, SOMEONE runs up the stone steps to the owlery.
6962	He stamps the snow off his boots.

6974	He stares at himself in a mirror.
6975	SOMEONE comes in wearing a smart black robe and a white bow tie.

6981	SOMEONE spots SOMEONE with SOMEONE.
6982	SOMEONE sees SOMEONE slowly descending the stairs.
6983	SOMEONE turns his attention from SOMEONE and sees SOMEONE looking like a princess in pink.

6986	He clicks his heels and bows.
6987	SOMEONE takes his arm and gives SOMEONE an excited little wave.

6990	Looking very apprehensive, SOMEONE walks stiffly beside SOMEONE.
6991	SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE.

7003	He swings from his hip flask and gives a shudder.
7004	SOMEONE sidles over to the towering SOMEONE and gives her a wink.
7005	He gestures towards the dance floor.
7006	Later, the pace hots up.
7007	The hall is jumping.
7008	SOMEONE is passed over the heads of the dancers.
7009	To people's annoyance, people won't dance.
7010	The four of them sit glumly at the end of the room.
7011	SOMEONE dances wildly with SOMEONE.
7012	People glare at SOMEONE.

7020	SOMEONE gives a great sigh.
7021	SOMEONE gets up.
7022	She goes to speak, thinks better of it, turns her back, and walks off.
7023	SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE.
7024	SOMEONE gets up and stalks off.
7025	Later, SOMEONE tries to reason with SOMEONE.
7026	She wipes away a tear.
7027	The boys escape up the stairs.
7028	SOMEONE flops miserably on the bottom step, takes off her party shoes, and rubs her feet.
7029	SOMEONE is still dancing with SOMEONE.
7030	SOMEONE rests his head on SOMEONE's chest.
7031	His hand slips to her bottom.
7032	She puts it firmly back on her waist.
7033	Disturbed by the bell, crows rise into the darkness.
7034	They swoop between the tall towers past one or two lighted windows.
7035	Snowflakes whirl outside the boys' bedroom.
7036	A large black crow flutters down onto the windowsill and peers in.
7037	Asleep in bed, SOMEONE is having a nightmare.
7038	He sees the dark cemetery with the winged stone statue.
7039	The cloaked skeleton clutches the long scythe.
7040	Behind it, stands the snow-covered mansion.
7041	Along the dusty paneled corridor, light shines from the open door.
7042	Inside the room, SOMEONE hovers as the young man kneels beside the armchair, revealing the dark mark tattooed on his arm.
7043	The large snake whispers to the figure hidden in the armchair.
7044	A green flash.
7045	SOMEONE's eyes spring open.
7046	SOMEONE appears, his dancing shoes slung around his neck.

7051	SOMEONE nods.
7052	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a knowing smile and goes.
7053	In the prefect's bathroom, SOMEONE slips off his dressing gown and lowers himself into a bath the size of a small swimming pool.
7054	He leans back under the bubbles.
7055	A mermaid in a stained glass window holds back her long golden hair to watch him.
7056	SOMEONE turns to the golden egg standing on the side of the bath.
7057	He opens the eggs.
7058	He slams it shut again.
7059	A ghostly figure appears out of the lavatory.
7060	She floats towards him.
7061	She dives into the bubbles.
7062	SOMEONE grabs the egg.
7063	He twists it open under the water.
7064	The egg glows brightly.
7065	SOMEONE takes a deep breath and sinks down after it.
7066	He bursts to the surface.
7067	She peers mischievously into the water.
7068	SOMEONE attempts to preserve his modesty with some bubbles.
7069	SOMEONE leans her head on his naked shoulder.
7070	In the library.
7071	SOMEONE puts the golden egg on the table.
7072	He and SOMEONE leave reluctantly.
7073	SOMEONE piles up his books and tidies his notes.
7074	SOMEONE leaves them alone.
7075	SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE apologetically.
7076	At the lake, people take bets.
7077	SOMEONE hands over the gillyweed.
7078	Three tall spectator pavilions have been erected in the lake.
7079	SOMEONE chokes on the gillyweed.
7080	Three of the competitors dive in.
7081	SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE in after them.
7082	Gasping for breath, he sinks down amongst the metal supports of the pavilions.
7083	He clutches his neck.
7084	Gills develop on either side like a fish.
7085	He looks down and sees his feet turn into flippers.
7086	He held up his hands as they become webbed.
7087	SOMEONE stares down into the water.
7088	SOMEONE suddenly hurtles up out of the water.
7089	He somersaults in the air like a dolphin and vanishes again under the surface.
7090	SOMEONE kicks out with his flippers and swims through the water weed over the rocks-strewn bed of the lake.
7091	It falls away in front of him into a deep ravine.
7092	He dives into the murky darkness.
7093	Arms held close by his sides.
7094	Fish swim beside him as he moves easily through the water.
7095	He is wearing shorts and a singlet with SOMEONE written on the back.
7096	His wand is in a sheath, strapped to his leg.
7097	He heads through a narrow channel, peering uncertainly through the cloudy water.
7098	He swims through ropes of dark green weed hanging like curtains in front of him.
7099	SOMEONE looks over his shoulder and spots a figure behind.
7100	SOMEONE is swimming strongly, a delicate filmy veil over her mouth and nose.
7101	Her long fair hair streams behind her.
7102	Something whips past her face.
7103	SOMEONE certainly disappears, pull down out of sight.
7104	SOMEONE is knocked aside by something as it flashes past.
7105	Recovering himself, he catches sight of a silvery tail vanishing into the Forest of Weed.
7106	SOMEONE follows the merperson as it leads him above the jagged rocks on the bottom of the lake.
7107	Far ahead, he sees the ruins of a stone archway.
7108	He kicks out strongly with his flipper feet.
7109	Tall columns rise around him like an underwater cathedral.
7110	He swims past ruined archways, their outline softened by algae and water weed.
7111	Four people in black cloaks float upright in front of him - - people, and a small girl with long fair hair.
7112	Their eyes are closed, their face is blank.
7113	Unfriendly looking merpeople lurk, ominously close, carrying sharp tridents, and lashing their tails.
7114	SOMEONE unties the rope around SOMEONE's ankle.
7115	He moves toward SOMEONE.
7116	A merman prepares to attack.
7117	SOMEONE appears.
7118	A transparent, bubble of air over his mouth and nose, he frees SOMEONE with his wand.
7119	The merman is scared off.
7120	SOMEONE taps his watch.
7121	SOMEONE nods and draws his wand to release SOMEONE, but a sharp, pointed trident is held at his throat.
7122	SOMEONE turns as the open mouth of a grinning shark looms towards him.
7123	The shark has human legs and arms and wears red shorts.
7124	It flashes past, bites through the rope, and swims off with SOMEONE.
7125	SOMEONE takes a firm grip on SOMEONE's arm.
7126	He looks at the girl with long, fair hair, now, floating alone.
7127	SOMEONE looks cautiously at the merpeople hiding in the weeds.
7128	He uses his wand to release the little girl.
7129	Eight minutes to 12.
7130	People are the first to the surface.
7131	They swim ashore.
7132	People hurriedly descend the stairs of the pavilion.
7133	SOMEONE appears on the surface with the shark.
7134	Immediately, its head transforms into SOMEONE.
7135	Wrapped in a dressing gown, SOMEONE watches the water anxiously.
7136	As SOMEONE struggles towards the surface with SOMEONE and the little girl, he notices his hands are no longer webbed.
7137	He is suddenly attacked from below, a horde of vicious little squid-like grindylows with sharp teeth and many legs nip at his ankles.
7138	He tries to kick them away.
7139	He releases his grip on SOMEONE and the little girl and pushes them up towards the surface.
7140	SOMEONE clutches his neck.
7141	Hundreds of the creatures attack him.
7142	He is almost suffocated by their tentacles.
7143	Struggling to fight them off, he pulls out his wand.
7144	Sparks fly, stunning the grindylows and sending them flying in all directions.
7145	SOMEONE sinks to the bottom.
7146	Twelve o'clock.
7147	SOMEONE and the little girl bob to the surface.
7148	SOMEONE leans out over the water and stretches out her hand.
7149	His gills now gone, SOMEONE drifts helplessly.
7150	He looks up at the patch of light above his head and with the last desperate effort, raises his wand.
7151	He rockets out of the water onto the landing stage, gasping for air.
7152	SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE.
7153	She kisses SOMEONE.
7154	She wraps a towel around him.
7155	SOMEONE puts his wand to his throat.
7156	SOMEONE is furious.
7157	SOMEONE is with SOMEONE.
7158	Wild-haired SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE with his mad, rolling eye and flickers his tongue.
7159	SOMEONE stares back into SOMEONE's scarred face, then walks away looking confused.
7160	SOMEONE swigs from his hip flask.
7161	In the forest at night.
7162	SOMEONE sees a black hat lying on the ground.
7163	He clutches the scar in his forehead.
7164	A man lies on his back among the fallen leaves heaped-in and lifeless.
7165	SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE's room.
7166	The door is closed.
7167	SOMEONE opens the door.
7168	On his way out, SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a long look.
7169	The tadpole-like licorice snaps, attract SOMEONE's attention.
7170	He takes a handful.
7171	They nip his fingers with their sharp, little teeth.
7172	He drops them onto the floor and stomps on them.
7173	Behind him, the doors of a cabinet swing open.
7174	A blue light glows from a large, stone vase in front of a flicking mirror.
7175	SOMEONE slowly walks towards it.
7176	Reflected in the mirror, he gazes down into the shining blue bowl.
7177	The cloudy surface swirls.
7178	SOMEONE sees a glow at the bottom of a deep shaft.
7179	He finds himself falling down into a crowded courtroom.
7180	He lands in a chair, sitting next to SOMEONE he recognizes.
7181	The man next to him shakes hand with SOMEONE right through SOMEONE.
7182	A disheveled man appears in a cage in front of the judge, SOMEONE.
7183	SOMEONE gasps.
7184	SOMEONE aims his wand at a young man hurrying from his seat.
7185	SOMEONE is dragged to the bench.
7186	His tongue flickers like a snake.
7187	SOMEONE is transfixed, horrified.
7188	SOMEONE falls from the bowl to the floor in SOMEONE's room.
7189	He puts his wand to his temple and drops a thread of memory into the pensieve.
7190	Leaving SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE hears voices from the open door of SOMEONE's store room.
7191	SOMEONE sees the dark mark on SOMEONE's arm.
7192	SOMEONE leaves quickly.
7193	He shows SOMEONE a small bottle.
7194	SOMEONE conducts the school band.
7195	The stands are crowded with flag-waving supporters.
7196	An enthusiastic, SOMEONE runs in, encouraging the crowd to cheer as an embarrassed SOMEONE enters the arena.
7197	SOMEONE follows.
7198	Her classmates perform a cheerleader routine.
7199	SOMEONE and his crony support SOMEONE, who appears with SOMEONE.
7200	A concerned SOMEONE accompanies SOMEONE who looks around nervously.
7201	Standing in front of a tall hedge, SOMEONE addresses the crowd.
7202	They gather around SOMEONE.
7203	SOMEONE stands before a narrow opening in the hedge.
7204	SOMEONE hugs SOMEONE tearfully.
7205	SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a friendly nod.
7206	Once again, SOMEONE lights the canon too soon.
7207	SOMEONE pats SOMEONE encouragingly on the shoulder as he tentatively enters the maze.
7208	SOMEONE watches him go.
7209	SOMEONE looks back towards the entrance and sees SOMEONE pointing surreptitiously to the left.
7210	He stares uncertainly down the narrow, misty path.
7211	Suddenly, the hedges close together behind him, blocking the way out.
7212	SOMEONE swallows hard and follows the direction SOMEONE has indicated.
7213	Each long path looks exactly the same.
7214	The thick, hewn hedges rise 25 feet on either side.
7215	Above his head, he can only see a narrow strip of sky.
7216	The intricate maze extends far around him stretching away into distance of mist covered valley.
7217	SOMEONE moves slowly and cautiously between the hedges.
7218	He turns and looks behind him fearfully.
7219	SOMEONE has come in through another entrance.
7220	As confused as SOMEONE, he runs along the narrow paths between the neatly clipped hedges.
7221	He stops uncertain of which way to go.
7222	He chooses a path.
7223	As he moves forward, it crashes closed in front of him.
7224	The hedges on either side grow together hemming him in.
7225	He forces his way through the dense branches as they close in around him, lashing him across the face.
7226	Meanwhile, SOMEONE plods along in his steady boots, carrying his wand.
7227	SOMEONE spins around as he hears a sound behind him.
7228	SOMEONE's eyes are glazed over.
7229	SOMEONE runs frantically between the hedges.
7230	She reaches a dead end and panicking, runs back the way she came.
7231	Her face clammy with fear, she stares uncertainly down the misty pathway.
7232	Hearing something behind her, she turns.
7233	SOMEONE hears her scream.
7234	SOMEONE leans over SOMEONE.
7235	She lies on the ground, staring slightly.
7236	He looks up.
7237	His eyes are cloudy.
7238	Sinuous roots creep towards SOMEONE from under the hedge.
7239	SOMEONE runs in the direction of the scream.
7240	He peers through the swirling mist and spots SOMEONE.
7241	SOMEONE draws back into the hedge as SOMEONE shines the lighted end of his wand straight into SOMEONE's face.
7242	As SOMEONE eyes are clouded over and he fails to see SOMEONE, he passes by.
7243	SOMEONE searches for SOMEONE.
7244	As he reaches her, she vanishes from sight, drawn under the hedge by a tangle of sinuous roots.
7245	SOMEONE points his wand upwards.
7246	High above, red sparks explode in the evening sky.
7247	A howling wind lashes the branches sending dust and leaves into the air.
7248	SOMEONE starts to run as the hedges starts to close together behind him.
7249	He dives head first through a closing gap and lands on the ground.
7250	SOMEONE sees a bright object in a distance.
7251	Heading towards it, he emerges onto a path between people.
7252	SOMEONE drops.
7253	SOMEONE aims his wand at SOMEONE and knocks him unconscious.
7254	He kicks SOMEONE's wand from his hand and raises his own wand.
7255	SOMEONE stops him.
7256	SOMEONE pushes him off and starts to run.
7257	SOMEONE follows.
7258	They jostle for position, grabbing each other by the shirt, pulling each other's back, fighting each other off.
7259	They see the trophy.
7260	They sprint forward, SOMEONE slightly ahead.
7261	The Triwizard Trophy gleams through the mist.
7262	The roots reach out and trips SOMEONE.
7263	SOMEONE surges past, then stops, and looks back.
7264	SOMEONE is dragged backwards, tangled in the roots and branches of the hedge.
7265	He struggles in vain to escape.
7266	The sinuous roots have twined around his neck, strangling him.
7267	SOMEONE looks at the gleaming trophy and back at SOMEONE.
7268	SOMEONE points his wand.
7269	The roots and branches loosen their hold.
7270	SOMEONE runs to SOMEONE and helps him to free himself.
7271	Exhausted and trembling, he scrambles to his feet.
7272	A strong wind flings leaves high into the air and the hedges advance.
7273	As the hedges close in behind them, they both sprint towards the shining trophy.
7274	Reaching it, they pause in front of it.
7275	They grab, one hand each.
7276	It spins like a Catherine wheel.
7277	They land beside a statue in the cemetery.
7278	They scramble to their feet.
7279	SOMEONE looks around the moonlit graveyard.
7280	The trophy is lying on the ground.
7281	SOMEONE clutches his forehead in agony.
7282	SOMEONE appears, clutching a small, wizened creature in a blanket.
7283	SOMEONE draws his wand.
7284	SOMEONE falls, dead.
7285	Aiming his wand, SOMEONE forces SOMEONE up into the arms of the statue.
7286	It traps him fast behind the handle of the scythe.
7287	A cauldron stands in front of SOMEONE.
7288	SOMEONE drops the pale, deformed creature into it.
7289	SOMEONE opens the Riddle family grave.
7290	He drops a bone into the cauldron.
7291	He draws a knife.
7292	He slices off his right hand into the cauldron.
7293	He slashes open SOMEONE's sleeve.
7294	He cuts SOMEONE's arm.
7295	SOMEONE's blood is added to the cauldron.
7296	The contents of the cauldron sieve and bubble.
7297	SOMEONE runs into the shadows as flames leap high into the night sky.
7298	The cauldron disappears.
7299	A ghastly, shapeless figure appears in front of SOMEONE, riving and twisting as it slowly takes human form.
7300	A veil of black smoke descends and unfolds the creature.
7301	SOMEONE slowly turns his head.
7302	His gleaming, gray skin is stretched tight over his bony features.
7303	He has sunken eyes.
7304	In place of a nose, his nostrils are two narrow slits.
7305	He runs his fingers over his hairless skull.
7306	SOMEONE emerges from the shadows.
7307	Now, draped in a black robe, SOMEONE opens his arms triumphantly.
7308	The dark lord admires his restored human form, a smile on his thin lips.
7309	Bowing low, SOMEONE holds it out.
7310	SOMEONE takes it in his long, bony fingers.
7311	SOMEONE presses his wand into the dark mark tattooed on SOMEONE's arm.
7312	He looks up in to the glowering sky.
7313	From the darkening clouds, arriving snaking ribbon of black smoke emerges.
7314	It twists and turns downwards, dividing in to separate plumes, each revealing a black-robed death eater, wearing a tall pointed hood, and a skeleton mask.
7315	As the smoke clears, SOMEONE faces them.
7316	He unmasks them.
7317	They fall to their knees.
7318	Snatching another mask.
7319	SOMEONE rips off his hood.
7320	He restores his hand in silver.
7321	Looking down at SOMEONE.
7322	He presses one finger in to SOMEONE's scared forehead.
7323	SOMEONE falls to the ground.
7324	He forces SOMEONE to bow.
7325	SOMEONE writhes in agony.
7326	He sends SOMEONE spinning.
7327	SOMEONE dives for cover.
7328	Summoning up every ounce of courage, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
7329	Red light streams from SOMEONE's wand, green light from SOMEONE's.
7330	The power from their wands collides and meets like molten lava in a burst of bright flame.
7331	Sparks fly as they struggle desperately to overcome each other.
7332	SOMEONE controls his quivering wand with both hands.
7333	SOMEONE's face is twisted with hatred.
7334	Streaks of light burst all around, illuminating the dark sky.
7335	The ghostly images of SOMEONE's victims appear.
7336	First SOMEONE, then SOMEONE, the old caretaker, killed in the mansion.
7337	SOMEONE's father and mother appear at his side.
7338	His father speaks.
7339	Breaking the connection, SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE.
7340	The cup flies into his hand.
7341	SOMEONE howls with frustration.
7342	SOMEONE lands with SOMEONE in the arena.
7343	The spectators go wild.
7344	SOMEONE senses that something is wrong.
7345	SOMEONE gets up.
7346	He tries to pull SOMEONE away.
7347	SOMEONE clings to SOMEONE's body.
7348	SOMEONE bursts through the spectators.
7349	He weeps over SOMEONE's body.
7350	SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE up.
7351	SOMEONE helps SOMEONE away.
7352	The students stand, stunned into silence.
7353	Still in a state of shock, SOMEONE walks into SOMEONE's room.
7354	SOMEONE slides shut the iron lock on the heavy wooden door.
7355	SOMEONE stands in a trance, pale and shaking, clutching his arm.
7356	His clothes are torn.
7357	His face is bloody.
7358	SOMEONE pulls up a stool and sits him down in front of the fire.
7359	SOMEONE's deep gash is revealed.
7360	He grips SOMEONE's arm.
7361	SOMEONE's face twists with agony.
7362	SOMEONE opens his hip flask but finds it empty.
7363	He runs into the next room and searches feverishly among bottles in a wooden box.
7364	They are all empty.
7365	SOMEONE stands in the doorway behind him.
7366	He searches the shelves.
7367	He glares at SOMEONE with his mad eye.
7368	Grabbing SOMEONE's arm, he sucks SOMEONE's blood from his fingers.
7369	The door bursts open, and SOMEONE is flung hard against the stone wall.
7370	SOMEONE grabs him.
7371	SOMEONE pours truth serum into SOMEONE's mouth.
7372	SOMEONE looks towards the locked trunk.
7373	SOMEONE points his wand.
7374	The lid flies open.
7375	Then six more trunks open, one inside the other.
7376	People peer into the trunk, down a deep shaft.
7377	A figure with one leg and one eye lies far below.
7378	SOMEONE sniffs the flask.
7379	They turn and watch his face and body start to twist with the violent convulsions.
7380	He wrenches off the leather patch with the mad, rolling eye, and flings it down.
7381	He transforms into a younger man, who lashes out angrily.
7382	It's SOMEONE's son.
7383	He lunges at SOMEONE.
7384	SOMEONE reveals the dark mark.
7385	SOMEONE uncovers SOMEONE's wound.
7386	SOMEONE presses his wand hard against SOMEONE's cheek.
7387	SOMEONE narrows his eyes and flickers out his tongue.
7388	The entire school is assembled in the great hall.
7389	SOMEONE finds SOMEONE packing his case in the boys' bedroom.
7390	The professor touches the velvet drapes on the four-poster bed.
7391	SOMEONE nods.
7392	He looks at SOMEONE reassuringly and leaves.
7393	In the courtyard, students say goodbye at the end of term.
7394	SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in the crowd and gives her a note.
7395	SOMEONE and her sister kiss SOMEONE goodbye.
7396	SOMEONE is flustered and blushes with embarrassment.
7397	SOMEONE walks along the cloisters as the Hogwarts' students say goodbye to the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons visitors.
7398	He smiles to himself.
7399	The galleon on the lake fires a last salute.
7400	Cheered by the Hogwarts students, the elegant Beauxbatons girls march away along the cloisters.
7401	The Durmstrang students follow, shaking hands as they go.
