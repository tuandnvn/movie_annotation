57864	SOMEONE flat on his back, woozily shaking his head.
58000	A beautiful dusk landscape.
58044	There is almost a touch of eagerness in his expression.

58317	And instantly there is a marked change in his attitude.
58339	There is one light burning, behind SOMEONE's head.
58546	There is a touch of urgency in his voice.
58756	There's a pause.
58814	People.
58846	People.
58901	Still dark, and only the unmoving glow of a cigar showing in the center of the apartment.
58945	There is a sigh of relief from both of them.
58951	SOMEONE' apartment.
58986	There is a pause as SOMEONE gropes for an answer.
59023	There is an expression of triumph on her face.

62046	A FLASH.
62054	And then.
62087	A certain sad suspicion.
62092	There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.
62108	A little paranoid.
62183	Almost unendurable.
62186	At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they are trying to block him.62200	And LAUGHING.
62243	Shoulders.
62244	Finally, the head.
62298	Finally.
62306	A lot.
62410	There's an audible AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from SOMEONE's brothers.

64340	Back in the corner.
64395	There is another KNOCK.
64559	Eight sharp.
64653	There is a break in the action.
64668	Behind him, in the washroom, is SOMEONE, washing his face and hands.64693	A high angle.
64746	There is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self- sufficiency, about her.
64834	There is a long silence.
64940	There is a knock at the door.
65145	There is a drink in her hand, and a suitcase beside her on the bed.
65228	A friendly smile.
65267	There is an exchange of suspicious looks between people.
65583	There, between a compact, lipstick and keyes, are some bills.

65895	Suddenly passionate.
65947	There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision.
65969	A sailboat.
65996	Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands.
66050	Then, quietly.
66067	And on that word.
66111	There is a large boulder nearby.
66144	But there is just no air.
66162	And some cheese and a couple of apples.
66172	Another nod.
66255	Just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal.
66322	Pallid, perhaps ill.
66325	People, watching her.
66456	People, looking out at the enemy.
66547	And on that.
66578	People, looking down at SOMEONE.
66747	An embarrassed pause.
66882	Applause.
66937	Then another page - the title page - written in SOMEONE's hand.
67168	The Freeway ahead.
67221	just blackness and rain.
67230	There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.
67368	There is a light on in the house.
