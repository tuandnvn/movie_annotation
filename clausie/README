This is an adaptation of Clausie 0.0.1 to work with Stanford CoreNLP 3.7.0.

ADAPTATION CONTENTS

* Stanford CoreNLP 3.7.0 by default process text into UniversalEnglishGrammar, needs to change back to EnglishGrammar.
* Certain relations has been changed, for example, purpose clause has been included by advcl (adverbial clause modifier)
* Fixing problems with "then" and comma:
* I drink some coffee, eat a banana -> 1 clause only [3       "I"     "drink" "some coffee"]
* I drink some coffee then eat a banana -> 1 clause only [3       "I"     "drink" "some coffee"]
Need to fix that into two clauses
